The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $\\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \\kappa/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\\kappa \\ \\simeq \\ \\varepsilon \\ \\simeq \\ 1/3$ and $H_\\star/H_0 \\ \\simeq \\ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.",

Instead of relying on exact integrations of the Sachs optical equations, we introduce a minimal deformation of the redshift relation z_eff(z) = z minus alpha times f(z), where alpha is a small amplitude and f(z) suppresses the correction at z greater than approximately 0.1. This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure. The framework provides a clean general-relativistic description of path-dependent redshift drift and yields concrete predictions for forthcoming low-redshift surveys.",

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $\\Lambda$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics.",

Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) A future measurement of Lense-Thirring (LT) precession using a binary radio pulsar is expected to yield the pulsar's moment of inertia ($I_{\\rm p}$). However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.",

Most, Anima Anandkumar ML4PS Workshop, Neurips 2025 accepted High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.",

Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble.

Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars.

Added erratum High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We perform the first 3D ab-initio general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant spanning a fraction of its cooling time scale. We find that neutrino cooling becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism after the gravitational-wave dominated phase (${\\sim}20\\ {\\rm ms}$ postmerger). Electron flavor anti-neutrino luminosity dominates over electron flavor neutrino luminosity at early times, resulting in a secular increase of the electron fraction in the outer layers of the remnant. However, the two luminosities become comparable ${\\sim}20{-}40\\ {\\rm ms}$ postmerger. A dense gas of electron anti-neutrinos is formed in the outer core of the remnant at densities ${\\sim}10^{14.5}\\ {\\rm g}\\ {\\rm cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to temperature hot spots. The neutrinos account for ${\\sim}10\\%$ of the lepton number in this region. Despite the negative radial temperature gradient, the radial entropy gradient remains positive and the remnant is stably stratified according to the Ledoux criterion for convection. A massive accretion disk is formed from the material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the stars. The disk carries a large fraction of the angular momentum of the system, allowing the remnant massive neutron star to settle to a quasi-steady equilibrium within the region of possible stable rigidly rotating configurations. The remnant is differentially rotating, but it is stable against the magnetorotational instability. Other MHD mechanisms operating on longer timescales are likely responsible for the removal of the differential rotation. Our results indicate the remnant massive neutron star is thus qualitatively different from a protoneutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae.",

V2: version accepted for publication in PRD Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Assuming a minimal $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM value ($\\gamma \\simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\\sum m_\\nu \\lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\\sum m_\\nu \\gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\\sim 2\\sigma$.

Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands).

Any energy injection from the dark sector can therefore be detected through these measurements. Dark compact objects and dark-matter substructures can modify the baryon temperature by transferring heat via dynamical friction. In this work, we evaluate the prospects for detecting dynamical friction-induced heating from dark compact objects with a mass in the range $10^2 M_{\\odot}$ to $10^5 M_{\\odot}$, as well as from axion minihalos, using upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that both the 21-cm global signal and power-spectrum measurements will be sensitive to dark compact objects that constitute about 10% of the dark matter, and will substantially improve our sensitivity to axion-like particles with masses in the range $10^{-18}$ eV to $10^{-9}$ eV.",

FDM, composed of ultralight scalar particles with masses $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} \\sim 10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, exhibits quantum pressure that suppresses the formation of small-scale structures below the de~Broglie wavelength, thereby delaying star formation and modifying the thermal history of the intergalactic medium. Using modified \\texttt{21cmFAST} simulations that incorporate both linear and nonlinear effects of FDM on structure formation, we analyze the two-dimensional 21~cm brightness temperature fields through the first- and second-order WST coefficients. The first-order coefficients, $S_1(j)$, quantify scale-dependent variance analogous to the power spectrum, while the normalized second-order ratio $R(j_1,j_2)=S_2/S_1$ captures non-Gaussian cross-scale couplings. We find that low-order couplings, particularly between large and intermediate scales, are highly sensitive to the FDM particle mass and remain robust under SKA1-Low-like thermal noise. Quantitatively, the WST coefficients yield pairwise distances of $\\Delta \\simeq 225$ between CDM and FDM with $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}}=10^{-22}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, demonstrating that this framework can effectively discriminate between wave-like and cold dark matter scenarios even under realistic observational conditions.

Reiprich, Angie Veronica, Florian Pacaud, Jakob Dietl, Fiona Knies, Manami Sasaki Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Hydra I galaxy cluster (Abell 1060) is a nearby example of a low-temperature cluster that exhibits intermediate cool core and non-cool core properties. We aim to extend the characterization of the intracluster medium (ICM) properties at least until $R_{200}$ and study the correlation between the X-ray emission and non-thermal emission within $R=0.15$$R_{500}$, and optical/IR galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8\\sigma$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons. We also estimate the average ICM temperature and metallicity of $\\langle k_\\mathrm{B}T \\rangle=2.27\\substack{+0.15\\\\-0.11}\\thinspace$ keV and $\\langle Z\\rangle=0.19\\substack{+0.05\\\\-0.03}\\thinspace Z_\\odot$, respectively, from the 0.2-0.5$R_{500}$ annulus. Overall, the temperature profile is broadly consistent with the average temperature profiles from hydrodynamical simulation and Suzaku between 0.28$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$.",

      "abstract": "Controlling weak-lensing shear biases from undetected galaxies in the era of Stage IV Surveys Lisa M Voigt Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational lensing of background galaxies by intervening matter is a powerful probe of the cosmological model. In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies.",

We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the galaxy--halo connection model together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.75 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{eV}$ (95% CL) and $m_{\\mathrm{FDM}} > 1.41 \\times 10^{-20}~\\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio).

Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning. Finally, we check that this baryon EoM works as well as an empirical baryon density profile for the FDM soliton formation, with the fractional errors $\\lesssim0.04$.

In this work we use measurements of the galactic UV luminosity function (UVLF) at high redshifts to constrain the dark acoustic oscillation feature at small scales in a model-agnostic way. We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs.

For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\\bf B}(r,\\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons.

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process.

The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \\ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.",

Moiseev 12 pages, 2 figures, accepted to Contributions of the Astronomical Observatory Skalnate Pleso Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Green Bean is a rare type of galaxy which represents a short-lived phase in the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterised by large-scale, powerful ionised clouds in the circumgalactic medium. Recent studies demonstrate that these extended ionised structures may reflect fading signatures of past AGN activity, often manifested in the form of large-scale ionisation cones. The analysis of their observational properties provides unique constraints on AGN lifetimes, feedback mechanisms, and transitions between radiative and kinetic modes of activity. In this paper we announce the first results of the project dedicated to the long-slit spectroscopic and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometric observations of Green Bean galaxies at the Russian 6-m telescope with SCORPIO-2 multi-mode instrument. We describe the data reduction and spectral fitting procedures that allow one to characterise ionisation conditions in extended gaseous regions of the galaxy SDSSJ095100.54+051026.7.",

Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies. Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \\approx 0.91$; Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \\approx 0.91$; Spearman $\\rho \\approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.",

Weaverdyck 36 Pages, 13 Figures; see also companion paper Penton et. al. 2025 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Over the last decade, the Australian Dark Energy (OzDES) collaboration has used Reverberation Mapping to measure the masses of high redshift supermassive black holes. Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{bol}})\\in [44.3, 47.5] \\mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.",

In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\\tau_g\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\\propto m_h^{-\\lambda}$ and $\\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\\tau_{gr}\\propto r^{-\\gamma}$, yielding density $\\rho_r\\propto r^{-2\\gamma}$ and $\\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\\varepsilon_u \\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration. The dependence of waiting time and step length on the particle mass suggests new constraints near $10^{12}$GeV.",

To appear in ApJ Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for $\\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.",

This phenomenon, known as 'redshift drift,' will provide a crucial direct test of cosmological models. The change in redshift is readily explained using the concept of conformal time which is the comoving distance of a galaxy in lightyears. We emphasize that the redshift drift is directly proportional to the average change in the cosmic expansion rate between the time of a galaxy's light emission and its absorption.

Version accepted in JHEAp Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model has been highly successful in predicting cosmic structure and evolution, yet recent precision measurements have highlighted discrepancies, especially in the Hubble constant inferred from local and early-Universe data. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising alternative for cosmological measurements, capable of reaching higher redshifts than traditional distance indicators. This work leverages GRBs to refine cosmological parameters independently of the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. Using the Platinum compilation of long GRBs, we calibrate the Dainotti relations-empirical correlations among GRB luminosity properties-as standard candles through artificial neural networks (ANNs). We analyze both the 2D and 3D Dainotti calibration relations, leveraging an ANN-driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to minimize scatter in the calibration parameters, thereby achieving a stable Hubble diagram. This ANN-based calibration approach offers advantages over Gaussian processes, avoiding issues such as kernel function dependence and overfitting. Our results emphasize the need for model-independent calibration approaches to address systematic challenges in GRB luminosity variability, ultimately extending the cosmic distance ladder in a robust way. By addressing redshift evolution and reducing systematic uncertainties, GRBs can serve as reliable high-redshift distance indicators, offering critical insights into current cosmological tensions.",

While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, by considering BH mergers within SIDM spikes, which can arise from models with a massive force mediator, we show that the GWs emitted are dephased in a distinct manner. To incorporate the feedback of the BH orbital motion that can significantly modify the DM profiles, we use $N$-body simulations to analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.",

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\\xi$), position-orientation ($\\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\\xi$ and ~5% for $\\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\\sim$10,000$\\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.",

With the advent of new radio, optical, and infrared sky surveys, it became possible to carry out additional studies of the 113 radio sources observed within this program using the 6-meter BTA telescope. Morphological features indicative of the evolutionary state of radio sources revealed that 9 objects exhibit signs of restarted activity, 12 can be classified as young, and 2 as dying. Based on their WAT/NAT and WRS morphologies, 24 sources are likely located within galaxy groups or clusters, or show evidence of jet reorientation. Additionally, four objects in the sample represent pairs of radio sources whose host galaxies are separated by only a few tens of kiloparsecs. Continuum spectra were constructed, and variability indices were calculated. A high proportion of sources with a variability index ($V>3$) is attributed to significant differences in angular resolution between the TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as to underestimated flux densities for certain double-lobed sources. A comparison of spectral indices derived from older and newer data indicates a decrease in the number of steep-spectrum sources in the sample. This reduction is most likely due to improved characterization of the low-frequency portion of the continuum spectra following the incorporation of GLEAM data. However, for some radio sources, the observed spectral changes may reflect internal evolution, that observed in a shift of the spectral peak or a roll-off in the radio spectrum towards lower frequencies, as evidenced by flux density measurements from various catalogues covering a period of up to forty years.",

Saridakis, Yi-Fu Cai Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\\sigma$, rising to $3.63\\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.",

Shojaei 25 pages, 3 figures, 2 table, Accepted for publication in JCAP Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph) Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio Mähönen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.",

SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1000$ galaxy posteriors per minute on a single GPU. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.",

This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We find that these objects typically have tage ~ tcoll < trelax, therefore, in an unexplored regime never observed before for a stellar system and potentially, highly unstable to runaway collisions. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. This evolutionary path would naturally explain many of the problematic characteristics of Little Red Dots, including that these objects are probably transient in the history of the Universe, that most of them would not emit X-rays since they would not yet have become massive black holes, and once they do, they would constitute a significant portion of the mass of the Little Red Dots. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range",

The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.",

If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($\\Gamma_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($\\sigma_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $\\sigma_u \\gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $\\sigma_u \\gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients.",

The observations have enabled a precise characterization of the Fe-K emission lines from the accretion disk corona (ADC) and a possible detection of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). The ADC component has at least two distinct regions. The Fe-K emission lines are remarkably broad, with a velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v=2300^{+900}_{-700}$~km~s$^{-1}$. This can be larger than what was observed in previous Chandra observations ($1120\\pm870$~km~s$^{-1}$) and recent XRISM observations of the similar Z-source GX 340+0 (360--800~km~s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, we marginally detect a blueshifted absorption feature, which we identify as either \\ion{Fe}{26} or \\ion{Fe}{25}, with outflow velocities of $-0.29c$ or $-0.26c$, respectively.

Dey Accepted for publication in the research in astronomy and astrophysics journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present the results of the multi-epoch broadband spectral study of 1ES 2344+514 and study the evolution of physical parameters. We used nearly simultaneous data obtained from 2017 June 6 to 2022 August 6 (MJD 57910 -- 59797) in optical, UV, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray wavebands from various instruments including Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, AstroSat (SXT and LAXPC), Fermi-LAT, and TeV flux from MAGIC. During 2017 July, 1ES 2344+514 appeared to be in the highest flaring state compared to other periods. We used the 0.5 -- 7.0 keV and 3.0 -- 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 -- 8.0 keV and 3.0 -- 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $\\gamma$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs. In this study, we found a weak correlation tendency between bolometric luminosity and magnetic field (B), as well as between bolometric luminosity and the break Lorentz factor ($\\gamma_{break}$).",

Sanjith A., Shantanu Desai High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We test whether the Efron-Petrosian (E-P) method can recover the inverse-square law dependence of the radio pulsar flux, using a synthetic catalog generated according to the specifications of the Parkes multi-beam survey using the {\\tt PsrPopPy} software. We find that the E-P method cannot reproduce the inverse-square law, except over a narrow range of flux thresholds and even here we don't get pristine agreement. The main reason for the deviation is that the synthetic radio pulsar catalog is truncated based on a cut on the pulsar signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has a non-linear dependence on the flux along with plenty of scatter. We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold. We then demonstrate that if we create a synthetic catalog based on a flux cut (instead of an SNR-based threshold), we can recover the true distance exponent, with an accuracy ranging from pristine agreement to within $\\pm 1 \\sigma$ depending on the chosen flux threshold.",

Lin Accepted to A&A. 9 pages, 3 figures High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits frequent short-duration flares with luminosity greater than 1e34 erg/s across multiple wavelengths. The origin of the flares is still unknown. We revisited the role of small planetary bodies, originally from the stellar disk, and their tidally disrupted fragments as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A*. We refined previous models by incorporating material strength constraints on the tidal disruption limit and by evaluating the evaporation dynamics of the resulting fragments. We analyzed the tidal fragmentation and gas-induced fragmentation of small planetary bodies with rubble-pile and monolithic structures. Using constraints from recent space missions (e.g., NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2), we estimated the survivability of fragments under aerodynamic heating and computed their expected luminosity from ablation, modeled as fireball flares analogous to meteor events. We find that planetary fragments can approach as close as 8 gravitational radii, consistent with observed flare locations. The fireball model yields luminosities from 1e34 to 1e36 erg/s for fragments whose parent bodies are a few kilometers in size. The derived flare frequency vs. luminosity distribution follows a power law with index 1.83, in agreement with observed values (1.65 - 1.9), while the flare duration scales as L^(-1/3), consistent with observations. We consider the young stars around Sgr A* as the planetary reservoir. Given a small-body population analogous in mass to the primordial Kuiper belt and the common existence of close-in super-Earths and long-period Neptunes, we show that this planetary reservoir can supply the observed flares.",

The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected.

Numerical results are obtained for matter composed of carbon nuclei. We find that the conductivity rises with temperature, following a power law sigma proportional to the 4th power of T in the semi-degenerate regime and sigma proportional to T in the nondegenerate regime, due to the intense creation of thermal electron-positron pairs and the resulting collisions among them.

Its X-ray spectrum (0.3-10 keV) is characterised by significant spectral variability observed by many authors, with a backbone with photon index ~2 occasionally superimposed by a hard tail. This spectral variability has been interpreted as the interplay between the X-ray corona and the relativistic jet. The X-ray fluxes in the 0.3-10 keV energy band are generally around ~10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1, making it easier to get sufficient statistics even with short exposures. Here I present a reanalysis of all the available X-ray observations with Swift (181 obs), XMM-Newton (7 obs), Chandra (1 obs), and Suzaku (2 obs) performed between 2006 and 2025.

Fryer, Gilles Ferrand 47 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables; accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The nature of the supernova remnants (SNRs) 3C 397 and W49B has long been a subject of debate, with prior studies offering conflicting interpretations between thermonuclear and core-collapse scenarios. To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$\\alpha$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations.",

Tothill High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present new radio-continuum observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant (SNR) N206, which we give the name \"Goat's Eye\". Goat's Eye contains an interior radio structure that is likely a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which we analyse in further detail. We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($\\alpha = -0.60\\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($\\alpha = -0.16\\pm0.03$). We also measure the polarisation and magnetic field properties of the PWN. Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual \"zig-zag\"-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between.",

Using 59.0 hours of data from the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and 6.3 hours from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 19-beam receiver, we searched for repeated bursts from these sources. No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs. Combining these non-detections with prior archival observations, we derived stringent upper limits on their repetition rates above 1 Jy under two statistical models: Poisson process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.5}$ to $10^{-1.9}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, while Weibull process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.4}$ to $10^{-1.5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude stricter than those reported in previous studies.

Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube.",

These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations.",

Accepted for publication in Astrophysics and Space Science High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The well-observed type IIP SN 2024bch with the short plateau is shown to be an outcome of the red supergiant explosion with the presupernova mass of 14-15 Msun, the explosion energy of 2x10^{51} erg, and presupernova radius of 1250 Rsun. The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s. The early-time spectral evolution indicates the presence of the circumstellar dense confined envelope with the mass of 0.003-0.006 Msun within 6x10^{14} cm. The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta.",

Liska 25 pages, 10 figures, accepted in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent observations of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN) have shown the presence of millimeter emission, whose origin remains unknown, from within parsec scales of the central black hole. We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_{\\nu}\\sim{\\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\\rm mm}/L_X\\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions.",

Submitted to Memorie della Società Astronomica Italiana (MemSAIt). Presented at the 8th Heidelberg International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (Gamma-2024), 2024 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) On 9 October 2022, the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever recorded (GRB 221009A) was detected. Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\\sigma$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign.",

The origin of this pattern remains debated, limiting how these isotopic signatures can be used to trace the precursors of terrestrial planets. Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion.",

Proceedings of Figuring the Invisible, Lucerne, Switzerland, 2023 Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph) For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. \"Science anxiety\" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled \"The Movements of the Universe\", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.",

Among these, we found four blazars (J 0923.5+4125, J 1221.3+3010, J 1503.5+4759, and J 1652.7+4024) showing possible indications of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) modulation. We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\\sim 3 \\sigma$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\\sim$ 48 days) reach $\\sim 4 \\sigma$.

To be published in Proceedings of Science, 87th Fujihara Seminar: The 50th Anniversary Workshop of the Disk Instability Model in Compact Binary Stars (DIM50th2025) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Double white dwarf binaries (DWDBs) with Helium components are progenitors to AM CVn binary systems. Their Galactic production rate may be given by the number of stably mass transferring DWDBs in the Milky Way. The theoretical criteria for stable mass transfer in DWDBs is calculated assuming that component white dwarfs are completely cold and degenerate. Respective fractions of surviving AM CVn and DWDB which merge are then calculated by applying this criteria to population synthesis estimates for Galactic DWDB. However, emerging observations of the local DWDB population suggest that Helium white dwarf (He WD) components are typically hot, and only partially degenerate when they begin mass transferring. Using recent numerical simulations of He WD donors in DWDBs, we qualitatively describe a temperature dependent stable mass transfer criteria for Galactic DWDBs. Mass transfer is even more stable than previously thought, or equivalently, DWDB mergers are even rarer. Realistic finite temperature treatments will deepen the dearth in observed AM CVn binaries compared to DWDB merger products.",

To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. Our aim is to constrain the physical mechanism responsible for the second optical flare, which may also provide clues to the origin of the initial event. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient and a uniquely bright UV counterpart. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conslusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. We propose a repeating TDE scenario within an AGN framework to explain the multi-wavelength properties of AT2019aalc and suggest a possible connection among ECLEs, BFFs, and TDEs occurring in AGNs.",

Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.",

Accepted for Publication in ApJ High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with ''bumps'' in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called ''super-Chandrasekhar\") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\\rm log}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. The current leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model involves an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. We test the validity of this theory by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass in the range $M_\\mathrm{CSM}=3.31-8.51 \\times 10^{-3} M_\\odot$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.",

Please note that the version 3 (v3) has been accepted for publication in ApJ, but version 2 (v2) is not High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \\sim 0.67\\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\\gtrsim6\\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.",

In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\\!\\lesssim\\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\\!\\gtrsim\\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.",

Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE this http URL this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \\texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \\texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\\alpha_{\\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 5.2$\\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).",

Olguin, Shuting Lin, Daniel Tafoya, Takeshi Sakai, Xing Lu, Fumitaka Nakamura Accepted for Publication in ApJ., 18 pages, 10 figures Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The core mass function (CMF) of prestellar cores is essential for understanding the initial conditions of star and cluster formation. However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 \\mu m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.",

Each simulation in the suite has a unique set of initial conditions and combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. The suite is designed to quantify theoretical uncertainties from halo-to-halo variance, as well as stellar and black hole feedback. We develop a novel weighting scheme that prioritizes regions of the input parameter space, yielding galaxies consistent with the observed present-day stellar mass--halo mass relation. The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus~(GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties. Our results highlight the necessity for large statistical samples to disentangle the stochastic nature of galaxy formation and robustly model the Milky Way's unique history.",

This paper aims to understand the detailed physical processes behind such behaviors and investigate how such an episodic star-forming scenario can explain the scatter in star-formation rate (SFR) of star-forming main-sequence galaxies. This is achieved through tracing back in time the history of z=0 star-forming central galaxies in the TNG100 simulation over the past 7-8 Gyrs. As the first paper in this series, we provide an overview of the episodic star formation history. We find that two branches of star formation typically develop during each episode: while one branch happens in heavily metal-enriched gas in the centers of galaxies, a secondary branch starts in lower-metallicity regions at galaxy outskirts where fresh gas first arrives, and gradually progresses to inner regions of galaxies. Additionally, the temporal variation in the SFR at galaxy outskirts is more significant than that at centers. As a consequence, the metallicities in both gas and young stars exhibit remarkably different distributions between SFR peaks and valleys. The resulting temporal SFR fluctuation within individual galaxies has an average of ~ 0.2 dex, while the intrinsic differentiation between (the historical mean of) galaxies is ~ 0.15 dex. These two together can well account for the scatter in SFR of ~ 0.25 dex as observed for z=0 star-forming main-sequence galaxies.",

Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) From the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we identify 14 off-nuclear broad (FWHM>1000 km/s) Halpha and/or Hbeta emission line sources that indicate spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (~2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.",

In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics.",

Accompanying 11-million row catalogue will be submitted to appear in Vizier, when journal volume/article# known Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The southern Galactic plane has been mapped at optical wavelengths and at under one-arcsecond angular resolution by the VST Photometric Ha Survey of the Galactic plane and bulge (VPHAS+). Anticipating the release of a uniform photometric calibration of the entire survey, we examine the properties of VPHAS+ ugriHa photometry of r < 19 mag. point sources in the third Galactic quadrant (longitudes 210^o to 260^o). We compare our interim calibration in gri with that of Pan-STARRS, the DECam Plane Survey (DECaPS-2) and Skymapper. We use the comparisons to identify small gri photometric offsets. Corrections to the Ha and u magnitude scales are determined via comparison with synthetic photometry. VPHAS+ and its northern counterpart, the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), are shown to closely align, where they overlap across the celestial equator. Aided by Gaia Data Release 3, SIMBAD, and specialist catalogues, we present selections of: A stars; sub-luminous stars; intrinsically-red luminous stars; young stellar objects; emission-line and OB stars. Attention is drawn to stellar variability as a contaminant in selecting emission line objects via (r - Ha) excess. It is argued the (r - i, r - Ha) plane is the better choice for this selection than (g - i, r - Ha). Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to ~7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6).",

We compute the intrinsic $M_{UV}$ LFs and lens-dependent effective volumes $V_{eff,\\ell}(M_{UV})$ for two of them (CATS, GLAFIC), and construct binned LFs with statistical (Gehrels) errors presented separately from the lens-model spread. When fitting each lens model independently with both the original and turnover-extended form (while keeping $M^*=-20.5$), we obtain decisive model selection in favour of a faint-end turnover. The peak of the turnover posteriors is at $\\alpha \\simeq -1$, $\\beta \\simeq 1.6$, and drive $M_T$ to the high side of our prior ($\\sim -18$) and the difference in normalization between CATS-GLAFIC is absorbed into $\\phi^*$. A similar magnification-bias test in the image plane gives a $B(\\mu)$ trend matching to what is expected, which provides an internal consistency of our selection and volumes. Our results indicate an early suppression of the UV LF at $z=6-8$, and carry implications for the ionizing contribution of ultra-faint systems during reionization.",

Out of 2416 fields with ALMA detections (from a total of 3,089 analyzed maps), we identify 474 multiple systems within a radius of 16 arcsec (equivalent to the 500 $\\mu$m Herschel beam-size): 420 doubles, 51 triples, and 3 quadruples. In each case the brightest source contributes, on average, 64, 48, and 42 per cent of the total flux in double, triple, and quadruple systems. The average combined ALMA flux density of the sources in double systems is comparable to that of the two brightest components within triple and quadruple systems. Non-parametric tests suggest that only a small fraction of the double systems ($\\lesssim13$ per cent) are comprised of sources with compatible redshifts, while 47-67 per cent of triple and quadruple fields contain at least one potentially associated pair. Simulations using a mock catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies suggest that 32 per cent of the double systems are likely physically associated ($\\Delta z < 0.01$, i.e. $\\lesssim$10 comoving Mpc at $z = 3$) and, while only 8 per cent of the triple and none of the quadruple systems meet this criterion, $\\sim$ 70 per cent of them include at least one likely associated pair. Our results suggest that enhanced star formation rates in submillimetre galaxies are primarily driven by internal processes rather than large-scale interactions. This study also provides a catalog of potential overdensities for follow-up observations, offering insights into proto-cluster formation and evolution.",

Comments are welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We use several smoothed particle hydrodynamics+N-body models as part of the GASTRO library to study the role of high-density star-forming clumpy regions and a single merger on the formation of the $\\alpha$-rich and $\\alpha$-poor populations in the disk galaxies. These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}<4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $>11$ Gyr, $\\alpha-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy.",

We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\\sim16$ kpc and $\\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($<30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended.

Using {\\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $\\mu$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\\% are tightly clustered ($<$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\\sim$18 K and density $\\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars.",

Accepted for publication in A\\&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Our comprehension of the history of star formation at $z>3$ relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\\rm H}\\alpha$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.",

Lanzoni Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey has secured high quality astro photometric data in two bands for 34 clusters never observed with HST. When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey.",

Ziliotto 11 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\\sim$85% have [Fe/H]<-2, and that roughly $\\sim$17% have [Fe/H]<-3.",

We report updated limits on the diffuse photon flux using Telescope Array's Surface Detector data collected over 14 years of operation. Our method employs a neural network classifier to effectively distinguish between proton-induced and photon-induced events. The input data include both reconstructed composition-sensitive parameters and raw time-resolved signals registered by the Surface Detector stations. To mitigate biases from Monte Carlo simulations, we fine-tune the network with a subset of experimental data. The number of observed photon candidates is found to be consistent with the expected hadronic background, yielding upper limits on photon flux $\\Phi_\\gamma(E_\\gamma > 10^{19} \\text{eV}) < 2.3 \\cdot 10^{-3} $, and $\\Phi_\\gamma(E_\\gamma > 10^{20} \\text{eV}) < 3.0 \\cdot 10^{-4} $ $ (\\text{km}^2 \\cdot \\text{sr} \\cdot \\text{yr})^{-1} $.",

Furthermore, based on rest-frame 1 $\\mu$m morphologies, we have derived spatially resolved stellar mass and SFR surface density ($\\Sigma_*$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) profiles for 46,313 galaxies with reliable structural measurements at $0<z<4$ and $\\log(M_\\ast /M_{\\odot})>8$, and provide the corresponding catalogue. For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z>2.5$), the median radial profile of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $\\Sigma_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z>2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.",

Hyland This paper has been accepted for publication in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia (PASA). At the time of this submission it is available online as Open Access Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We report the first observations in a rare family of class II methanol maser transitions in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward three southern high-mass star formation regions, along with the first maser detected in the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH line. The $8_2 \\rightarrow 9_1 A^{-}$ methanol transition was observed in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH (at 28.9 GHz and 41.9 GHz respectively) toward three sources; G358.93-0.03, NGC6334I and G345.01+1.79, all of which are star formation regions with recent maser flaring events. We report the first maser detection of the 41.9 GHz line in $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03 and the first confirmed maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward NGC6334I. Additionally we report a maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03, meaning that with our detection of the 41.9 GHz line, this is the first isotopic detection of these lines toward G358.93-0.03. The newly detected maser transitions are associated with the primary millimetre continuum sources (MM1) in both G358.93-0.03 and NGC6334I, within the varying positional uncertainties.",

Goicoechea, Ducheng Lu, David Teyssier Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We analyzed archival Herschel observations of water vapor emission toward the Horsehead photon dominated region (PDR), along with supporting ground-based and airborne observations of CO isotopologues and fine structure lines of ionized and atomic carbon to determine the distribution and abundance of water vapor in this low-UV illumination PDR. Water emission in the Horsehead nebula is very weak and, surprisingly, extends outward beyond other PDR tracers such as $^{12}$CO or [CI] 609 $\\mu$m, reaching as far out as [CII] 158 $\\mu$m. We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within ~40\\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed. Water vapor abundance in the model reaches $3.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ at $A_V \\sim 3$ mag. However, the ground state $o$-H$_2$O 557 GHz line is systematically overestimated by the models by at least a factor of 7 for any values of the model parameters. This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required.",

With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature -- due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features -- making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$\\alpha$ star formation rate of SFR$_{H\\alpha} = 0.024 \\pm 0.001$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most \"star-forming\" clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable H$\\beta$ emission, we find (for the first time at $z>5$) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions -- highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.",

Girart, Zhi-Yun Li, Anna Miotello, Zhaohuan Zhu, Alice Zurlo Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent discoveries of streamer-like structures around protostellar sources challenge the traditional picture of isolated, axisymmetric star formation. Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems.",

We present a chemical survey of 16 starless cores (including five prestellar cores) in the Orion A and B molecular clouds, targeting CH3OH, N2H+, CCS, and c-C3HD, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and the Yebes 40-m telescope. CH3OH was detected toward all targets, confirming its ubiquity in starless cores, consistent with previous surveys in Taurus and Perseus. ACA imaging shows that CH3OH, CCS, and c-C3HD generally trace the outer layers of the dense cores outlined by N2H+, each exhibiting distinct spatial distributions. Meanwhile, Comparison with Yebes data reveals an extended, flattened CH3OH component. CCS and c-C3HD tend to be detected or non-detected together across cores, while cores near dust-rich regions on a large scale often lack both, suggesting environmental influences linked to the interstellar radiation field. Within individual cores, CCS typically resides in an outer layer relative to c-C3HD. Our findings underscore the importance of high-resolution studies for understanding the origins and spatial differentiation of COMs and carbon-chain molecules in cold, quiescent environments.",

Comments welcome. Code available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at this https URL, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware.",

Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses < 0.03 MSun.",

Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O>1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O<1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks.",

Follow-up spectroscopy with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) was used to confirm their symbiotic nature and to characterize the cool and hot components of the full sample, including systems from earlier work. We report 14 newly confirmed bona fide symbiotic stars and identify 6 additional strong candidates. Photometric variability was examined using our data and archival light curves from multiple all-sky surveys. Most systems are variable, with the majority showing periodic modulation consistent with orbital motion or pulsations. Possible photometric orbital periods are reported for 19 confirmed and 3 candidate systems, pending spectroscopic confirmation. Eight objects exhibit signs of outburst activity. In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf.

      "abstract": "Evidence for Phenylium Reactivity under Interstellar Relevant Conditions Jean-Christophe Loison, Corentin Rossi, Nicolas Solem, Roland Thissen, Claire Romanzin, Christian Alcaraz, Ugo Jacovella Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Recent work by Kocheril \\textit{et al.}\\cite{kocheril2025} claimed that phenylium--the cyclic structure of the \\ce{C6H5+} species--is unreactive toward key interstellar molecules such as molecular hydrogen (\\ce{H2}) and acetylene (\\ce{C2H2}). This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \\cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}. The study focused on the reactivity of \\ce{C6H5+}, formed via the radiative association between \\ce{C4H3+} and \\ce{C2H2}, believed to be a major pathway for phenylium formation in astrochemical model, e.g. \\cite{byrne2024}. Here, we present new experimental and theoretical evidence that challenges this assumption. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with \\ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism, indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, and that further investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space--a process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation and growth--is essential.",

Wouterloot, Harriet Parsons, Sarah Graves, Takayoshi Kusune, Archana Soam 15 pages, 11 figures, accepted by PASJ Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field. This bright-rimmed cloud appears optically to be one single cloud illuminated by the UV light from the excited star of IC 1396, however our Stokes I image and 13CO(J=3-2) archival data suggest that this cloud is not a simple, single structure, but appears to be composed of two parts on first glance; a head part with wings and a tail, and a north-west extension this http URL molecular clouds are generally filamentary and it seems likely that the initial structures of bright-rimmed clouds are expected to be also generally elongated, we examined the possibility that the structure was created from a single elongated cloud by the UV impact. We compared the cloud structure with a simulation study that investigated the evolution of prolate clouds exposed to the UV radiation from various directions and found that this apparent two-part structure could be reproduced in a situation where a single filamentary cloud is obliquely illuminated by UV light. The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction. We roughly estimated the magnetic strength and stability in three parts of the cloud and found that the cloud head is most likely to be supercritical.",

Davis Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and constructed a set of dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations. In this study, we adopted 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 out of 12 cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.05$, while the other two cases exhibit $|f_{\\rm model}-f_{\\rm true}|\\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derived the chemical properties of each structure. For the stellar ages, our models recovered the negative gradients in the bars and discs, but exhibited relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components were constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\\rm model}-t_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\lesssim1\\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduced the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, as well as all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the discs and halos. Apart from the bulge in the simulated galaxy Au-18, the mean stellar metallicities of all other components were constrained with absolute biases of $|Z_{\\rm model}-Z_{\\rm true}|\\rm\\le0.5\\,Z_{\\odot}$.",

Accepted to MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Charting the Epoch of Reionization demands robust assessments of what drives the production of ionizing photons in high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and requires better predictive capabilities from current observations. Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1<z<8$, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\\xi_\\rm{ion}$). We consider $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ and $W_\\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\\beta_\\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\\xi_\\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$, $W_\\lambda$([OIII]) and $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\\lambda(\\rm{H\\alpha})$ or $W_\\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\\beta_\\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\\rm{neb}\\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\\xi_\\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\\sim0.15\\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\\sigma_\\rm{int}\\sim0.035\\,$dex.",

In this work, we aim to find a simple and effective formula to estimate the stellar mass from the images of galaxies delivered by the currently popular DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \\texttt{photomass\\this http URL} to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate. Additionally, we tuned another version of the formula to the magnitudes provided by the Siena Galaxy Atlas 2020 (SGA-2020) with a scatter of 29\\%. For both\\,--\\,our default and SGA-2020 formula, we offer two alternatives derived from different calibrations of S$^4$G masses that were based on different methods and assumptions.",

Main result: Fig. 6 (direct-Te MZR) and 9 (Impact of selection effects). Accepted for publication in A&A Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5<z<7$. Using $\\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\\,\\rm Z_\\odot$ for M$_\\star$ $\\approx5\\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.",

Vargas 27 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\\sim L^\\star$ galaxies.",

In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary \"bones\" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.",

With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\\rm core}^{\\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\\rm gas}^{\\rm bound}$), $M_{\\rm core}^{\\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.",

Mayer, Rüdiger Pakmor, Thorsten Naab, Oliver Zier, Alexei V. Ivlev, Tommaso Grassi, Paola Caselli, Volker Springel 16 pages, 12 Figures; updated version Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\\rm rad}> 10\\, {\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\\vert \\mathbf{B}\\vert_{\\rm max}>10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.",

Skinner, Manuel Guedel Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We report results of Chandra X-ray observations of CI Tau, a young magnetically active classical T Tauri star for which previous studies have reported periodic variability attributed to a massive planet in a short-period orbit. CI Tau was clearly detected by Chandra in four separate observations acquired in late 2023. The X-ray emission was steady in the first two observations with a characteristic plasma temperature kT ~ 2 keV (~23 MK) and X-ray luminosity log Lx = 29.74 erg/s. During each of the last two observations obtained two weeks later the count rate increased slowly and the X-ray plasma temperature was much higher but remained nearly steady at kT ~ 4 - 5 keV (~46 - 58 MK) and peak luminosity log Lx = 30.5 erg/s. Such variable X-ray emission in T Tauri stars accompanied by high plasma temperatures is a signature of magnetic activity, consistent with the known presence of a strong magnetic field in CI Tau. We summarize the variable X-ray emission properties of CI Tau within the framework of T Tauri stars of similar mid-K spectral type, identify possible variability mechanisms, and assess the effects of stellar X-ray irradiation on the claimed planet.",

In this work, we validated the model inferences of the 1D-3D coupling models using 18 well-studied stars from the Kepler LEGACY Sample. We compared our estimates of the fundamental parameters determined with other six pipelines and obtained good consistency. The results indicate that the 1D-3D coupling models can be applied to characterizing solar-like stars with confidence. Our analysis showed similar pattern for the surface term in stars with effective temperature range from ~5000 K to ~6400 K, suggesting that the surface term of the 1D-3D coupling models is simpler and easier to deal with than that of models using classical atmosphere.",

Kazachenko, David Berghmans, Elke D'Huys, Marie Dominique, Ritesh Patel, Dana-Camelia Talpeanu, Cole A. Tamburri, Rahul Yadav 11 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJL Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present fast cadence and high resolution observations of flare ribbons from the Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). Utilizing the short-exposure observations from the EUI High Resolution Imager in EUV (HRIEUV), we find small-scale blob/bead-like kernel structures propagating within a hook at the end of a flare ribbon, during the impulsive phase of a C9.9-class solar flare. These bead structures are dynamic, with well-resolved spatial separations as low as ~420-840 kilometers (3-6 pixels) - below the observable limit of full-disk solar imagers. We analyze the evolution of the plane-of-sky apparent velocity and separation of the flare ribbon structures, finding evidence for multiple processes occurring simultaneously within the flare ribbon. These processes include - quasi-periodic pulsation (QPP)-like brightenings, slow back-and-forth zig-zag motions along the ribbon, rapid apparent motions along the ribbon (600+ km/s), and stationary blob-like structures. Finally, we conduct Fast Fourier Transform analysis and analyze the start times of exponential growth in the power spectrum at different spatial scales across the flare ribbon. Our analysis reveals that the ribbon beads form with a key spatial separation of 1.7-1.9 Mm, before developing into more complex structures at progressively larger and smaller spatial scales. This observation is consistent with predictions of the tearing mode instability.",

We report the measurements of N, O, V, Zn, and Ba, and the upper limits for Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Eu for the first time. SMSS 0224$-$5737 exhibits low C abundance and high N and O abundances suggesting that C is converted to N by the enhanced mixing during the evolution. The abundance pattern up to the Fe-peak elements is generally in good agreement with the average abundance of EMP stars, although a notable feature is the high [Zn/Fe] ratio ([Zn/Fe] $= +0.88$). We confirm the enhancement of the first-peak neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Zr) and determine a low Ba abundance [Ba/H] $= -5.25$, that is, [Ba/Fe] $= -1.45$. The extremely high ratio of [Zr/Ba] $= +2.60$ makes SMSS 0224$-$5737 the EMP star with the most pronounced weak $r$-process signature observed to date. The abundance pattern of the neutron-capture elements is compared with the yields from $r$-process nucleosynthesis models. The sharp decline in abundances beyond Zr disfavors neutron star merger or electron-capture supernova models, but are reproduced either by proto-neutron star wind models or by magneto-rotational supernova models. Considering the high [Zn/Fe] ratio, a magneto-rotational supernova is the most plausible origin of SMSS 0224$-$5737. This study demonstrates that the abundance measurements of both light and neutron-capture elements, even at low abundances, are crucial for unveiling the astrophysical sites of the weak $r$-process.",

Kurtz, Hideyuki Saio, Hiromoto Shibahashi 24 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) An asteroseismic analysis has revealed a magnetic field in the deep interior of a slowly-rotating main-sequence F star KIC9244992, which was observed by the Kepler spacecraft for four years. The star shows clear asymmetry of frequency splittings of high-order dipolar gravity modes, which cannot be explained by rotation alone, but are fully consistent with a model with rotation, a magnetic field and a discontinuous structure (glitch). Careful examination of the frequency dependence of the asymmetry allows us to put constraints on not only the radial component of the magnetic field, but also its azimuthal (toroidal) component. The lower bounds of the root-mean-squares of the radial and azimuthal components in the radiative region within 50 per cent in radius, which have the highest sensitivity in the layers just outside the convective core with a steep gradient of chemical compositions, are estimated to be $\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathrm{r}}^{\\min}=3.5 \\pm 0.1$ kG and $\\mathsf{B}_{\\phi}^{\\min}=92 \\pm 7$ kG, respectively. The much stronger azimuthal component than the radial one is consistent with the significant contribution of the differential rotation although the star has almost uniform rotation at present. The estimated field strengths are too strong to be explained by dynamo mechanisms in the radiative zone associated with the magnetic Tayler instability. The aspherical glitch is found to be located in the innermost radiative layers where there is a steep gradient of chemical composition. The first detection of magnetic fields in the deep interior of a main-sequence star sheds new light on the problem of stellar magnetism, for which there remain many uncertainties.",

On the Sun, flares typically occur close to spots. In this paper we test this the connection between spots and flares on other stars. We detect 218,386 stellar flares on 14,163 spotted stars using a new algorithm called \\textsc{toffee}. Inhomogeneous spot distributions mean that as stars rotate they become brighter when less spots are facing the observer, and dimmer when more spots are facing the observer. We determine that flares occur when the star is brighter $49.97\\pm 0.21\\%$ of the time, i.e. there is an equal preference for the flares to occur when the star is relatively bright or dim. We therefore find no evidence for a correlation between flare rate and spot occurrence, contrary to what is seen on the Sun.",

We deployed pairs of telescopes for each emission line that were equipped with narrowband filters centered on, and several nanometers away from, the center wavelengths of the lines. The secondary continuum telescopes were used to measure and remove the combined continuum K- (electron) and F- (dust) corona, which dominate coronal emission at optical and infrared wavelengths. Significant emission was detected from all three lines from 1.03 solar radii (Rs) continuously outward to at least 6 Rs. The brightness of the lines and continuum are absolutely calibrated to the solar disk, and are validated by a comparison with LASCO-C2 observations made at the same time. Using these observations, we inferred the line emission ratios resolved throughout the middle-corona (defined as 1.5 to 6 Rs) for the first time. These line ratios are a probe of the electron temperature, which have important implications for constraining models of coronal heating and the characterization of solar wind formation, yet these emission lines have scarcely been quantified beyond 3 Rs in the corona. This study demonstrates the enduring potential of eclipse observations for coronal physics and suggests that future spacecraft missions could observe these lines farther out than has been attempted previously.",

Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) White dwarfs (WDs) are the final fate of about 97\\% of the stars in our galaxy, making them vital tracers of stellar history. A fraction of WDs exist in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems, accreting matter from a nearby companion star. A subset of CVs undergo episodic rapid mass transfer, termed dwarf novae (DNe) outbursts. Some accreting WDs exhibit near sinusoidal photometric variations, interpreted as $g$ mode pulsations. However, identifying pulsation modes in accreting WDs remains challenging due to the paucity of available observed modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive computation of the observable $g$ mode frequencies across a range of WD parameters, varying the WD mass, size of the newly accreted layer and core temperature. We also introduce a novel method for mode identification based on the time evolution of pulsation periods following an accretion episode. Our mode identification method does not rely on the direct detection of the consecutive radial mode orders, frequently required in isolated WDs. Moreover, this work improves upon our previous WD modeling efforts. We use a more realistic core temperature in addition to thermohaline mixing and element diffusion enabled during the accretion phase.",

Reep, Charles Kankelborg 15 pages, 7 figures; to appear in ApJ Letters; for animations please contact the lead author Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) On April 17, 2024, the third successful Hi-C sounding rocket flight, Hi-C Flare, recorded coronal images in Fe XXI 129 A emission from 11 MK plasma during the post-maximum phase of an M1.6-class solar flare, achieving unprecedented spatial (~300 km) and temporal (1.3 s) resolutions. The flare started at 21:55 UT, peaked at 22:08 UT, and lasted ~40 minutes. Hi-C observed for over five minutes (22:15:45 to 22:21:25), starting roughly eight minutes after flare maximum. A sudden compact bright burst - 875 +/- 25 km wide, lasting 90 +/- 1.3 s, displaying a plane-of-sky motion of ~50 km/s toward the loop apex, and splitting into two toward the end - occurs near the foot of some post-flare loops. Its size and brightness are reminiscent of flare-ribbon kernels during a flare's rapid rise phase, kernels marking sites of sudden heating and hot plasma upflow, making its occurrence during the late phase surprising. Such isolated brightenings in a flare's post-maximum phase are rare, and have not been previously reported. The kernel was detected in all SDO/AIA channels. Its 1600 A light curve peaked ~50 s earlier than its 131 A light curve, similar to that of flare-ribbon kernels, albeit with a smaller delay of ~25 s, during the impulsive phase of the flare. In SDO/HMI magnetograms, the kernel sits in unipolar positive magnetic flux near an embedded clump of negative flux. Although localized magnetic reconnection within the kernel (a microflare) cannot be ruled out for its cause, the observations favor the localized brightening being an isolated, exceptionally late flare-ribbon kernel, resulting from an exceptionally late burst of the flare's coronal reconnection.",

      "abstract": "Data-driven Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations with the MURaM Code: the Emergence of Active Region 11158 and the X2.2 Flare Feng Chen Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code to the extensively studied flare-productive active region 11158. We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment.",

However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales.",

Servidio Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Space Physics (physics.space-ph) In space plasmas, the rarity of collisions leads to complex structures in the velocity space where a turbulent cascade of the velocity distribution function fluctuations is thought to occur. Previous studies have explored this phenomenon using the Hermite decomposition of the ion velocity distribution function (VDF) in both magnetosheath data and numerical simulations. In this work, we investigate the Hermite spectrum of the ion VDFs measured by Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. We analyze a superalfvénic stream at a radial distances of $R \\approx 28 R_{sun}$ and a subalfvénic at $R \\approx 11 R_{sun}$, the former characterized by a prevalence of VDFs with suprathermal beams (also known as hammerhead). The Hermite analysis is also compared with various proxies of energization and dissipation, in order to establish a connection between turbulent cascades in real space and those in the velocity space. A qualitative agreement between the energization proxies and the Hermite analysis is observed. The results are suggestive of the presence of a dual cascade in real and velocity space.",

N'Diaye, P. de Laverny, N. Nardetto, A. Matter Accepted for publication in A&A Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Aims: We aim to characterize the physical and morphological properties of the binary system AFGL 4106, composed of two evolved massive stars. Understanding its mass-loss processes and circumstellar environment offers insight into the late stages of stellar evolution in massive binary systems. Methods: We obtained high-angular--resolution, high-contrast imaging using VLT/SPHERE with ZIMPOL (optical) and IRDIS (near-infrared) across multiple filters. We used aperture photometry to extract the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each star, and applied radiative transfer modelling to study the system and its surrounding dusty environment. Results: The observations resolve both components of the binary and unveil a complex, dusty nebula featuring asymmetric structures and cavities. SED fitting yields stellar temperatures of T$_1 = 6723\\pm196$ K and T$_2 = 3394\\pm264$ K, along with bolometric luminosities of L$_1 = (7.9 \\pm 0.18) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$ and L$_2 = (3.8 \\pm 0.11) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$. These values support the classification of the primary as being in a post-red supergiant (post-RSG) phase and the secondary as an active red supergiant (RSG). The luminosity ratio, combined with the inferred radii, indicates that both stars are at close yet distinct stages of their evolution. The binary is surrounded by an extended shell whose asymmetric morphology and large-scale features suggest interaction with the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM), and possibly the presence of a third, undetected companion. Conclusions: These observations provide the first resolved view of AFGL 4106's system and its dusty envelope. Our analysis sets constraints on the physical properties and evolutionary status of the system. This work contributes to understanding mass-loss processes in massive binaries and the shaping of nebulae around evolved stars.",

Work developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Accurate forecasts of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) arrival times and impact geometry remain a major challenge for space-weather operations. Coronagraph-based techniques typically achieve mean absolute errors of order ten hours, while in situ measurements at L1 provide excellent magnetic-field information but only tens of minutes of warning. In this work we introduce X-CME, a framework that links in situ flux-rope reconstructions at intermediate heliocentric distances with a physics-based CME propagation model. The internal magnetic structure is obtained with an elliptical cylindrical, radial poloidal flux-rope model and embedded into a tapered torus CME geometry. The subsequent propagation is computed by solving a drag-based equation of motion in a Parker solar-wind background, including gravitational deceleration, self-similar expansion of the cross section, and an explicit calculation of the CME wetted area and swept area in the ecliptic plane. We apply X-CME to two events observed by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft, respectively, and propagate the reconstructed structures to Earth and Mars. For both cases, the model reproduces the observed in situ signatures at L1 and predicts the CME arrival time at Earth with errors of a few hours (typically about 2-4 hours), while correctly distinguishing between central encounters and glancing blows. These results demonstrate that combining intermediate-distance magnetic reconstructions with a geometrically consistent propagation scheme can substantially improve CME arrival-time forecasts and impact assessment in the inner heliosphere.",

Our simultaneous analysis of the light curves and radial velocity curve shows that V2790 Ori is a W-subtype contact binary with a mass ratio of $q = 0.322(\\pm0.001)$ and a shallow contact degree of $14.8(\\pm0.6)\\%$. The orbital period analysis based on 445 eclipsing minima reveals a secular decrease at a rate of $\\dot P = -3.18 (\\pm 0.75) \\times 10^{-8}\\mathrm{d~yr^{-1}}$, superimposed with a cyclic variation with an amplitude of $A = 8.98 (\\pm 2.19) \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{d}$ and a period of $ P_3 = 7.44 (\\pm 0.52)~\\mathrm{yr}$. The secular decrease is caused by AML via magnetic braking, while the cyclic period variation is explained by the light-travel time effect due to a third body, which is likely to be a brown dwarf. Furthermore, our analysis indicates a mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one at a rate of $1.22(\\pm0.29) \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$. A model with a cool spot on each component was adopted to fit the O'Connell effect observed in the light curves. Since the O'Connell effect varies over time, we identified a solar-like magnetic activity cycle with a period of approximately 5.4 yr by analyzing the magnitude difference ($\\Delta m$) at the two light maxima and the O'Connell effect ratio. In addition, evolutionary analysis suggests that V2790 Ori is a newly formed contact binary that evolved from a detached phase into the present contact configuration.",

The observations were obtained approximately 30 minutes before the onset of the X1.2 flare. The active region exhibited strongly curved penumbral filaments, sunspot rotation, and shear motions along the polarity inversion line (PIL), which led to a highly stressed magnetic field configuration that stored sufficient energy to release multiple M- and X-class flares. The first flare signatures appeared as small-scale brightenings, each with a width of a few tenths of an arcsecond, that trace penumbral filaments in the trailing sunspot.",

      "abstract": "Predicted white-light solar flare emission from the F-CHROMA grid of models Sascha Ornig, Mats Carlsson Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Much of a solar flare's energy is thought to be released in the continuum. The optical continuum (white light) is of special interest due to the ability to observe it from the ground. We aim to investigate the prevalence of white-light (WL) emissions in simulations of purely electron beam-driven solar flares, what determines the occurrence of these enhancements, and the underlying causes. We utilized the F-CHROMA grid of flare simulations created using the radiative hydrodynamics code RADYN. We probed the spectral index, total energy, and low-energy cutoff to draw conclusions about their relationships to the white-light intensity. Furthermore, we calculated the 6684 Å continuum intensities, the Balmer, and the Paschen ratios. Finally, we analyzed two particular cases, one with high 6684 Å intensity and one with a large Balmer ratio, to determine the dominant mechanisms in these simulations. 33 of the 84 flares included in the F-CHROMA grid show white-light intensity enhancements that exceed 0.1% relative to the pre-flare level. We conclude that, with the parameters presented in the F-CHROMA grid, purely electron beam-driven simulations of solar flares are not able to reproduce observed WL enhancements, as the maximum enhancements in the grid are below 4%. The total energy (which is correlated with the maximum beam flux) is the main factor for deciding whether excess white-light emissions will be detectable. There is a linear relationship between the Balmer (and Paschen) ratio and the relative continuum increase. Both case studies show that during the time of maximum WL excess, hydrogen ionization and subsequent recombination in an optically thin medium is the dominant mechanism for WL continuum emission enhancements. Increased H$^-$ emission in the photosphere as a result of radiative backwarming becomes dominant during the declining phase of WL emissions in both case studies.",

Many have been already identified such as fibrils, filament feet, and arch filament systems. Still, high resolution observations show a wealth of structures that remain elusive. We have observed a puzzling, unprecedented chromospheric fibril singularity in close vicinity of a blow-out solar jet and a flaring loop. We aim to understand the magnetic nature of this singularity and the cause of its activity using coordinated high- resolution multi-wavelengths observations. We aligned datasets from Solar Orbiter, SST, IRIS, and SDO. We re-projected the Solar Orbiter datasets to match the perspective of the Earth-based instruments. We performed potential field extrapolations from Solar Orbiter/PHI data. We analysed the spatial and temporal evolution of the plasma structures and their link with the surface magnetic field. This leads us to derive a model and scenario for the observed structures which we explain in a general schematic representation. We have discovered a new feature, a singularity in the chromospheric fibril pattern. It is formed in a weak magnetic field corridor between two flux concentrations of equal sign, at the base of a vertically inverted-Y shape field line pattern. In this specific case some activity develops along the structure. Firstly a flaring loop at one end, secondly a blow-out jet at the other end, where a coronal null-point was present and associated with a chromospheric saddle point being located onto the fibril singularity.

Table A.1 is available in electronic form (Sect. 7) Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as \"transition disks\") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \\gtrsim 0.01$ at $\\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M > 30$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M < 13$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor. Our modular design enables direct adaptation to future photometric missions like PLATO or Earth 2.0.",

To address these applications, we present Kratos-polrad, a novel GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer code built upon the heterogeneous computing framework of Kratos, designed for self-consistent and efficient polarization calculations. It utlizes comprehensive treatment of Stokes parameters throughout photon propagation, featuring transforms the grain-lab frame transforms using quaternion algebra and consistent non-linear polarization extinction in cells, which are useful in modeling radiative transfer processes with scatterings by aligned dust grains. The code implements two-step polarimetry imaging that decouples Monte Carlo sampling of scattering physics from imaging geometry, enabling efficient synthesis maximizing the utilization of photon packets. Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations. By leveraging massive GPU parallelism, optimized memory access patterns, and analytical approaches for optically thick cells, Kratos-polrad achieves performance improvements of $\\sim 10^{2}$ times compared to CPU-based methods, enabling previously prohibitive studies in polarimetric astrophysics.",

One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.",

Kempton, Justin Lipper, Leslie Rogers, Fernanda Correa Horta, Shi Lin Sun 19 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, in review at AAS Journals Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Sub-Neptunes represent the largest exoplanet demographic, yet their bulk compositions remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\\sim 100$ to $700\\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes.",

ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis.",

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase (ELP) flares exhibit a second peak in warm coronal emissions minutes to hours after the main peak of the flare. This phase is all but negligible, and it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the solar cycle and what governs it. Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between May 2010 and May 2014 based on properties such as eruptivity, magnetic configuration, and late-phase duration, delay, and strength in order to understand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their behavior on a general scale. Methods. We primarily made use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as complementary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and to see if ELP flares differ from the general flare population. We quantified the criteria for ELP flare definition and determined the characteristics of the flares. Results. Our analysis shows that about 10\\% of all flares with a GOES class $\\geq$C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803). This percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares are considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their higher-energy counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations. The majority of this type of flare are confined (67%), more so than in the general flare population ($\\geq$C5.0). There appears to be a (linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio of the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9, and exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously reported.",

Decades later, Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (HRIEUV), operating halfway between Earth and the Sun, revealed thousands of even smaller brightenings in the quiet corona - tiny \"campfires\" that are smaller and far more frequent than the fundamental nanoflares observed from 1 AU. We analyze over 12,000 of these events, deriving their thermal energies using multiple geometric models to account for volume uncertainties. Although absolute values vary, all models yield consistent power-law energy distributions and ranges, confirming their flare-like behavior. These picoflares, spanning $10^{20}$--$10^{24}$ erg, were detected by the Solar Orbiter EUI Imager while the spacecraft was at 0.56 AU from the Sun. They occur up to sixty times more often than nanoflares seen from Earth orbit and supply about 1% of the quiet-Sun coronal heating power. This previously unseen energy source may be a missing component in the solar energy balance. Their discovery extends the flare energy spectrum to smaller scales, and future Solar Orbiter observations at 0.28 AU may reveal the most fundamental flare events that sustain the million-degree solar corona.",

Stapelfeldt, Ryo Tazaki, Jennifer B. Bergner, Emmanuel Dartois, Jennifer A. Noble, William Thompson Accepted in A&AL (4 pages, 3 figures) Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The James Webb Space Telescope provides unprecedented information to study ices in protoplanetary disks. However, the saturation of ice bands in highly inclined disks hinders the measurement of ice abundances using classical spectroscopy. This is unfortunate as the presence and more importantly abundance of ices plays a key role in, e.g., the evolution of dust (because it modifies the sticking properties) and the composition of planetesimals and exoplanetary atmospheres. To overcome this issue and quantify the ice abundance within disks, we introduce a new method based on measuring the changes in the apparent disk thickness as a function of wavelength, which is directly and quantitatively related to the grain opacity. Specifically, we expect i) that the increased opacity within ice bands should result in a thicker disk than in the adjacent continuum, and ii) the thickness variations to be proportional to the abundance of ice. We extracted the disk thickness in model images of edge-on disks containing different abundances of water ice, as well as in James Webb Space Telescope spectral imaging of four edge-on disks. For both models and observations, the disk thickness decreases toward longer wavelengths except across the positions of ice absorption features where the thickness is enhanced across the band. In the model images, we demonstrate that this effect increases with ice abundance without any hint of saturation. This definitely demonstrates the presence of the ice species within each disk and confirms our expectation that this method can be applied to estimate ice abundances. Thanks to this method, it will thus be possible to constrain the ice abundance in highly inclined disks with disks model fitting. Unlike spectroscopic analysis, this method is not subject to saturation and should therefore be more robust and applicable to all disks for which the two surfaces can be resolved.",

We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.",

Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the parameter $R_{\\rho}$, which allows one to explore in an approximate way the efficiency of semiconvection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.",

Fitzgerald Submitted at JATIS. 36 pages, 12 figures Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Exoplanet research is essential for understanding planetary formation and the potential for life beyond our solar system. The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations.",

Medinaceli, S. Mei, Y. Mellier 21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The Euclid system performance is defined in terms of image quality metrics tuned to the weak gravitational lensing (WL) cosmological probe. WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope.",

In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.",

In the current reference file, the correction coefficients derived for each pixel are averaged over each of the four detector quadrants. In this work, we compute a new pixel-based non-linearity correction using in-flight calibration observations with the internal tungsten lamp flats acquired between 2011 and 2013. We derive the new correction coefficients by fitting a third-order polynomial to the accumulated signal ``up-the-ramp\" for each pixel. Approximately 2\\% of IR detector pixels are flagged as bad, and a solution cannot be computed. For these, we use the quadrant averages of the new correction coefficients. An accompanying report (\\cite{huynh2025}) provides detailed testing results using both internal flats and external science targets acquired in a variety of observing modes.

With the rise of satellites, mobile networks, and other wireless technologies, radio telescopes are struggling with radio frequency interference (RFI), which can masquerade, block or distort astronomical signals. In this chapter, we explain where RFI comes from, how it affects observations, and discuss different ways to reduce or remove interference. The techniques presented here reflect the state of the art in real-time RFI mitigation at the time of publication and include methods such as filtering, digital processing, and optimal scheduling. The proposed catalogue also explores new ideas like satellite avoidance through scheduling, the use of intelligent surfaces to block interference, and advanced computer algorithms to clean up data. The chapter also highlights the need for strong cooperation between astronomers and spectrum regulators to protect radio frequencies for future discoveries. By combining technical solutions and better policies, we can help ensure that radio astronomy continues to provide important insights into the universe.",

Results showed 95.01% believed extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, with 62.59% holding definitive rather than probable convictions. Participants exhibited massive pluralistic ignorance, a 'cosmic closet', underestimating social circle beliefs by 46.07 percentage points despite near-universal personal conviction. Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14). These findings demonstrate that consensus misperception operates along two dimensions, prevalence and intensity, and that even scientifically engaged audiences resist belief revision via expert consensus information.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient and precise method to identify weak stability boundary structures based on deep neural network. The geometric and dynamical properties of weak stability boundary structures are firstly analyzed, which provides further insights into the training of the deep neural network models. Then, the optimal hyperparameter combinations are determined by examining the identification precision of the trained deep neural network models. The performance of the models with the optimal hyperparameter combinations is further validated using the representative test datasets, achieving the precision of 97.26-99.91%. The trained models are also applied to constructing weak stability boundary structures.",

Poludnenko Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.",

An efficient and reliable method for prioritizing the most promising targets is therefore essential. In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class. We establish a tiered framework of ideal ratios, beginning with $\\approx 108$ for G-type stars (anchored by the Earth-Sun system), and decreasing by a factor of two for K-type ($\\approx 54$) and M-type ($\\approx 27$) stars, respectively. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation, showing that exoplanets whose $d/D_s$ ratios are close to these empirically derived values consistently exhibit high Earth Similarity Index (ESI) scores. We propose that these tiered ratios represent \"Habitability Main Sequences,\" analogous to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stars, providing a valuable and straightforward tool for the astronomical community to rapidly screen large datasets and efficiently shortlist high-priority candidates for further investigation with next-generation observatories.",

This eliminates the need for injection-recovery tests to compute detection limits and avoids the explicit definition of a detection threshold.

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\\mathrm{eff} = \\, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.",

We argue that the lowest detectable debris cross section may be reduced by 10-100x by analysis of stacks of image frames collected at high rates rather than single frame data. In particular, instead of a pixel as a spatial region, the analysis is based on a \"phase-space-pixel\" which corresponds to an angular velocity and space region and whose intensity is computed by a weighted stacking of spatial pixels corresponding to a test debris trajectory within a wide camera field-of-view (FOV). To isolate debris signals from background, the exposure time is set to match the time it takes a debris to transit through the instantaneous field of view. Debris signatures are detected by multiscale X-ray processing of the data cube. Radiometric analysis of line integrals shows that sub-cm objects in Low Earth Orbit can be detected and assigned full orbital parameters by this approach.",

The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\\pm0.2)\\;\\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber.

The $\\beta$ Pictoris system is a particularly favorable target, as its proximity and directly imaged planets allow for precise astrometric monitoring. We present astrometric constraints on the presence of binary planets and exomoons in the $\\beta$ Pictoris system using archival observations from the GRAVITY interferometer and SPHERE instruments. We calculate these limits by modeling the motion of the two orbiting planets and introducing an additional perturbation to the model that simulates the astrometric motion caused by an exomoon orbiting the planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b. We find that for short orbital periods ($\\approx50$ days), a lunar companion is only allowed if its mass remains below $\\approx 180~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.6~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $3\\sigma$ confidence. At intermediate periods near 300 days, we exclude moons more massive than $\\approx 65~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.2~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $3\\sigma$ confidence. At longer orbital periods, we place the tightest constraints, ruling out any potential exomoon above $\\approx 50~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.15~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $700$ days and $\\approx 30~M_{\\oplus}$ ($0.1~M_{\\text{Jup}}$) at $1,100$ days (both at $3\\sigma$ confidence).

Lin Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, 12 pages, 5 figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Type II orbital migration is a key process to regulate the mass and semimajor axis distribution of exoplanetary giant planets. The conventional formula of type II migration generally predicts too rapid inward migration to reconcile with the observed pile-up of gas giant beyond 1 au. Analyzing the recent high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations by Li et al. (2024) and Pan et al. (2025) that show robust outward migration of a gas accreting planet, we here clarify the condition for the outward migration to occur and derive a general semi-analytical formula that can be applied for broad range of planet mass and disk conditions. The striking outward migration is caused by azimuthal asymmetry in corotation torque exerted from cicumplanetary disk regions (connecting to horseshoe flow) that is produced by the planetary gas accretion, while the conventional inward migration model is based on radial asymmetry in the torques from the circumstellar protoplanetry disk. We found that the azimuthal asymmetry dominates and the migration is outward, when the gap depth defined by the surface density reduction factor of $1/(1+K')$ is in the range of $0.03 \\lesssim K' \\lesssim 50$. Using simple models with the new formula, we demonstrate that the outward migration plays an important role in shaping the mass and semimajor axis distribution of gas giants. The concurrent dependence of planets' accretion rate and migration direction on their masses and disk properties potentially reproduces the observed pile-up of exoplanetary gas giants beyond 1 au, although more detailed planet population synthesis calculations are needed in the future.",

Hin, Thorsten Kleine, Alessandro Morbidelli, Francis Nimmo Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Despite the fact that the terrestrial planets formed from the protoplanetary disk, their compositions show marked departures from that of solar nebula condensates. Metallic cores fix oxygen fugacities ($f$O$_2$s) of the planets to 5 (Mercury) to 1 log units below the iron-wüstite (IW) buffer, orders of magnitude higher than the nebular gas. Their oxidised character is coupled with a lack of volatile elements with respect to the solar nebula. Condensates from a solar gas at different temperatures ($T_0$) have Fe/O (by mass) of 0.93 ($T_0$ = 1250 K) to 0.81 ($T_0$ = 400 K), far lower than that of Earth (1.06). Because the reaction Fe(s) + H2O(g) = FeO(s) + H2(g) proceeds <600 K, temperatures at which most moderately volatile elements (MVEs) have condensed, oxidised planets should be volatile-rich, and vice-versa. That this is not observed suggests that planets did not accrete from equilibrium nebular condensates and/or underwent additional volatile depletion/$f$O$_2$ changes. Indeed, MVEs in small telluric bodies (Moon, Vesta) indicate near equilibrium evaporation/condensation at IW-1 and 1400-1800 K. Volatile-depleted elemental yet near-chondritic isotopes of larger telluric bodies (Earth, Mars) reflect mixing of bodies of variable volatile depletion, overprinted by volatile-undepleted material. From the Cr- and Ti isotopes in the BSE, such undepleted matter has been proposed to be CI chondrites. 6% CI added late to an enstatite chondrite-like proto-Earth would match the Earth. However, because Earth is an end-member in isotopic anomalies of heavier elements, no combination of existing meteorites alone can account for its chemical- and isotopic composition. Instead, the Earth is made partially or essentially entirely from an NC-like missing component. If so, the oxidised-, yet volatile-poor nature of inner solar system bodies, including Earth and Mars, is intrinsic to the NC reservoir.",

The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the ten-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We present a simulation of Rubin's discovery of Hildas with the Sorcha (Merritt et al. 2025; Holman et al. 2025) survey simulator and the recovery of their light curves. We constructed a synthetic Hilda population model which includes distributions of orbital properties, sizes, collisional families and colors. We included two color classes corresponding to the Jupiter Trojan populations (Wong & Brown 2017). We applied three distinct populations of sinusoidal light-curves to this same orbit-size-color model: (1) a Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) fit to rotational periods and amplitudes from the Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al. 2009) (2) a super-fast rotator (SFR) population (0-3 hours) and (3) a super-slow rotator (SSR) population (100-1400 hours). Over the ten-year simulated survey, we predict LSST will discover ~33,400 Hildas, a fivefold increase over the known population. Using a multiband Lomb-Scargle Periodogram via Astropy (Price-Whelan et al. 2022) we confidently recover ~46.5% of Hildas in our LCDB-based population, higher than typical in observational searches. This suggests our light-curve population model may differ from the intrinsic population. We find strong biases in light-curve amplitude, with recovery efficiency dropping sharply below 0.1 magnitudes, while biases from rotational period are comparatively weak aside from cadence-related features such as LSST's ~36 minute revisit cadence. ...",

A search of shallower data obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, conducted when components A and B receded from 2.5 to 2.9~au from the Sun, yielded no detections, suggesting that the fragments had either ceased to exist or were not substantially active during this period. The uncertain fate of C/2019 Y4 highlights the challenge in understanding the state of presumably disrupted comets. Our review of six other presumably disrupted long-period comets reveals that negative confirmations were not reported for half of them, leaving their disruption presumptions inconclusive.",

Villaver Accepted for publication in A&A, 22 pages, 8 plots Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We present the characterization of the TOI-6041 system, a bright ($V = 9.84 \\pm 0.03$) G7-type star hosting at least two planets. The inner planet, TOI-6041b, is a warm Neptune with a radius of $4.55^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\\,R_\\oplus$, initially identified as a single-transit event in \\textit{TESS} photometry. Subsequent observations with \\textit{TESS} and \\textit{CHEOPS} revealed additional transits, enabling the determination of its $26.04945^{+0.00033}_{-0.00034}$~d orbital period and the detection of significant transit timing variations (TTVs), exhibiting a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 1~hour. Radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the APF spectrographs allow us to place a $3\\sigma$ upper mass limit of $28.9\\,M_\\oplus$ on TOI-6041b. In addition, the RV data reveal a second companion, TOI-6041c, on an 88~d orbit, with a minimum mass of $0.25\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. A preliminary TTV analysis suggests that the observed variations could be caused by gravitational perturbations from planet c; however, reproducing the observed amplitudes requires a relatively high eccentricity of about 0.3 for planet c. Our dynamical stability analysis indicates that such a configuration is dynamically viable and places a $1\\sigma$ upper limit on the mass of TOI-6041c at $0.8\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. An alternative is the presence of a third, low-mass planet located between planets b and c, or on an inner orbit relative to planet b -- particularly near a mean-motion resonance with planet b -- which could account for the observed variations. These findings remain tentative, and further RV and photometric observations are essential to better constrain the mass of planet b and to refine the TTV modeling, thereby improving our understanding of the system's dynamical architecture.",

Schneider, Christiane Helling 21 pages, 18 figures, submitted to A&A on 22. November 2022, rejected and not re-submitted Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) WASP-39b is one of the first extrasolar giant gas planets that has been observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example metallicity and mineral ratios. In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes, material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (> 100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency. The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations. We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through JWST observations.",

However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown dynamically disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be surveyed, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle. Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first observations going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 $\\rm M_\\oplus$. We also provide updated parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect at least 26 additional RV signals corresponding to stellar activity and 4 signals that are planet candidates. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.",

The Kepler-1649 system, hosting two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, provides a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric evolution in the extreme environments typical of M-dwarf systems. In this Letter we show that both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales. Using a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion escape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.8 to 4.0 Gyr. The results reveal a clear decline in total ion escape rates with stellar age, as captured by a nonparametric LOWESS regression, with O$^{+}$ comprising 98.3%-99.9% of the total loss. Escape rates at 4.0 Gyr are two to three orders of magnitude lower than during early epochs. At 0.8 Gyr, planet b exhibits 3.79$\\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c, whereas by 4.0 Gyr its O$^{+}$ escape rate becomes 39.5$\\times$ lower. This reversal arises from a transition to sub-magnetosonic star-planet interactions, where the fast magnetosonic Mach number, $M_f$, falls below unity. Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion, both planets may have retained significant atmospheres, suggesting potential long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into atmospheric retention in the Kepler-1649 system and inform future JWST observations of similar M-dwarf terrestrial exoplanets aimed at refining habitability assessments.",

Under review at AAS journals, after 1st round of referee review Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) We report the discovery of TOI-4507 b, a transiting sub-Saturn with a density $<$ 0.2 g/cm$^3$ on a 105-day prograde orbit around a 700 Myr old F star. The transits were detected using data from TESS as well as the Antarctic telescope ASTEP. A joint analysis of the light curves and radial velocities from HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE confirmed the planetary nature of the signal by limiting the mass to be below 20 $M_\\oplus$ at 95% confidence. The radial velocities also exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and imply that the planet orbits the star in a prograde orbit with a sky-projected obliquity $\\lambda=-9_{-49}^{+53}$ deg ($|\\lambda|<80$ deg at $3\\sigma$). With these characteristics, TOI-4507 is one of the longest-period systems for which the stellar obliquity has been measured, and the planet is among the longest-period and youngest ''super-puff'' planets yet discovered.",

      "abstract": "Sub-Snowline Formation of Gas-Giant Planets in Binary Systems Ilay Kamai, Hagai B. Perets, Jakob Stegmann, Evgeni Grishin Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 17 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates an inner dust trap. After removing evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars) and higher-order systems, we find that gas giants position is a linear function of the truncation radius. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, evolved systems are generally inconsistent with the predictions, which further supports the model and points to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.",

      "abstract": "Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Cores After Giant Impacts You Zhou 26 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, and 5 supplementary figures Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277--5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.",
