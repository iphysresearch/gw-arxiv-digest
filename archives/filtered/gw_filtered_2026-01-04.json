      "abstract": "Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves: Spin-wave Optics through Black Hole Scattering Zhao Li, Shaoqi Hou, Wen Zhao General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational-wave (GW) scattering in strong gravitational fields is a central problem in GW lensing. Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.",

The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.",

Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively.

Vinodkumar General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints. To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\\mathcal{C}_{\\max}\\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\\lambda_{\\rm BL}\\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.",

Working in the coincident gauge, we perform the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and classify QSN models into distinct cases according to the numbers of their primary constraints. For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively. This indicates that additional modes are strongly coupled on cosmological backgrounds.",

The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves.",

In addition to the well-known Sagnac phase shift, we identify an additional contribution originating from a relative rotation in the polarization vectors. We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance.

Lopes Accepted for publication in the Chinese Journal of Physics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.",

We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.",

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.",

      "abstract": "From Principles to Effective Models: A Constructive Framework for Effective Covariant Actions with a Unique Vacuum Solution Kristina Giesel, Hongguang Liu General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.",

Saridakis General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.",

Motivated by these features, we explore time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills condensates as non-linear classical background fields to model QGP. We first study quarks in gluon backgrounds and show that quark back-reaction can break the isotropy of the condensate for certain initial conditions. We then compute the one-loop finite-temperature effective action using the background-field method and heat-kernel expansion. The resulting thermodynamic pressure increases with temperature but exhibits an approximately logarithmic dependence. This is expected, as this is the de-confined phase of QGP; it is not exactly an ideal gas due to self-interaction. We also perform lattice calculations for the system to contrast continuum and lattice perspectives. We then add the GW to the thermodynamic QGP model and show that certain frequencies of the GW can induce instabilities in the QGP. Our analysis explores the limitations and role of non-perturbative, time-dependent backgrounds in semi-classical description of Yang-Mills dynamics.",

D 112, 124085 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Next-generation gravitational wave (GW) experiments will explore higher frequency ranges, where GW wavelengths approach the size of the detector itself. In this regime, GWs may be detected not just through the well-known mechanical deformation by tidal forces but also via induced effective currents in electromagnetic background fields. However, the calculation of this signal requires the GW metric in laboratory coordinates of the detector, and an accurate transformation to all orders into this frame is necessary. In this work, we derive a closed-form expression for the metric transformation of general chirp-like waveforms expressed in terms of the transverse-traceless GW metric, its integral, and its derivative. For more complex signals, where analytical integration is impractical, we provide an efficient approximation based on Taylor expansions of the retarded time to coalescence. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied to calculate the signal response of a large class of detectors. Our approach provides essential tools for designing and interpreting high-frequency GW experiments that search for compact object mergers at MHz to GHz frequencies beyond the long-wavelength limit.",

D 112, 103047 (2025) General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Many astrophysical processes can produce gravitational wave (GW) sources with significant orbital eccentricity. These binaries emit bursts of gravitational radiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic timing of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary. The presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst timing. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel approach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing models account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction effects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the inner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that incorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the binary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the binary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN precession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's semilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable information about the presence and properties of the third body, including its mass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the tertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts from such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN corrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of hierarchical triples.",

By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with mass ranging from about 5 to 30 solar masses, and the maximum compactness around 0.2. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases.

Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering.

Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.",

The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.",

Black holes are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a ``spike''. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\\sim 130$ unmerged IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like galaxy.
