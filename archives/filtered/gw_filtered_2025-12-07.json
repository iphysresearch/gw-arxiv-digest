      "abstract": "Popcorn EMRIs: Transient Gravitational Wave Signals and Their Analysis in Schwartz Space Pau Amaro Seoane, Kostas Tzanavaris General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P>1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.",

Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise. The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities. Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination. The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity. This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source. As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice. We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles. Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations. By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $\\phi_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized. The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs.",

In this work, we built a hybrid search pipeline that combines matched filtering and deep learning to identify stellar-mass binary black hole candidates from detector strain data. We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmark the sensitivity of our method and compare it with existing search pipelines. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach has comparable sensitivity for injections with a source-frame chirp mass greater than 25$\\,$M$_{\\odot}$, and below this threshold our sensitivity drops off for signals with a network SNR less than 15. We also observe that our search method can identify a significant population of unique candidates. Furthermore, we conduct an offline search for gravitational wave candidates in the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), yielding 31 candidates previously reported by the LVK with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\\rm astro}\\geq0.5$. We identify two other candidates: one previously reported only in a search conducted by the Institute for Advanced Study, and one previously unreported promising new candidate with a $p_{\\rm astro}$ of 0.63. This unique candidate has a high chirp mass and a high probability that the primary black hole is an intermediate-mass black hole.",

Our analysis builds on LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)'s results, finding that the source is consistent at a probability of $\\geq 96\\%$ with the merger of two first-generation, nearly equal-mass, low-spin black holes, forming a remnant within the pair-instability mass gap. The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\\log_{10}B\\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\\% interval for the $(2,\\pm2)$ peak amplitude. Collectively, these results reinforce GW250114 as a landmark event for a precision test of gravity.",

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a systematic post-Newtonian treatment of binary charged black holes immersed in external magnetic fields within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and quantify the magnetic field imprints using matched filtering techniques. Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations.",

In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.",

Font 31 pages, 26 figures, open to suggestions General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present results from long-term, numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers modeled using both, fully tabulated, finite-temperature, equations of state and their corresponding hybrid representations. The simulations extend up to 150 ms which allows us to assess the role of the treatment of finite-temperature effects on the dynamics of the hypermassive neutron star remnant. Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-Høiland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors. The late-time excitation of inertial modes, previously reported in studies based on hybrid EOS, is fully supported by the tabulated, finite-temperature EOS simulations presented here, which account for thermal effects in a more consistent way.",

Mishra, Michael Nee, Lisa Randall High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Inflation generally assumes a field with nonzero potential that leads to inflationary expansion happening at arbitrarily early times. We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.",

Garcia, Sarunas Verner High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production from isocurvature perturbations in spectator scalar fields during inflation. These energetically subdominant fields develop blue-tilted power spectra through inflationary dynamics, generating second-order scalar perturbations that source a stochastic GW background. The mechanism naturally satisfies CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced signals at smaller scales across a broad frequency range $10^{-20} - 1$ Hz. We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation. For spectator fields with effective masses $0.5 \\lesssim m_{\\chi,\\mathrm{eff}}/H_I$, the resulting GW energy density reaches $\\Omega_{\\text{GW}} h^2 \\sim 10^{-20}$-$10^{-12}$, accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and next-generation CMB experiments. Our analysis reveals that GW-induced constraints exceed current isocurvature bounds. We examine both unstable (curvaton-like) and stable (dark matter) spectator fields, demonstrating strong sensitivity to reheating temperature, inflaton-spectator coupling, and decay dynamics. This framework establishes isocurvature-sourced GWs as a powerful probe of early universe physics, enabling simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through coordinated multi-frequency GW observations.",

If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.",

In the classical case, we model the interactions in a typical chaotic configuration, identifying Extreme Gravitational Interactions (EGIs), namely transients in which the system manifests complex, highly-energetic dynamics. We then concentrate on the main part of the work, by selecting these EGIs as initial data for the general relativistic case, and performing a campaign of numerical relativity simulations. To provide a comprehensive menu of cases, we investigate different global configurations. By comparing with the more ``quiet'' two-body inspiral, we observe strong nonlinear emission of gravitational waves. The multi-body signals have been inspected by employing both Fourier and wavelet analyses, showing net differences among the global configurations. The wavelet analysis reveals the reminiscence of the EGIs in the three black holes problem. Such a survey of simulations might be a guide for future observations.",

The output of gravitational nonlinear processes can also be sensitive to quantum features of the input states, indicating that nonlinearities can act both as sources and detectors of quantum features of gravitational waves. Due to gauge and quantization issues in strongly curved spacetimes, we work in the geometric optics limit of gravitational radiation, but we expect the key ideas extend to situations of astrophysical interest.

      "abstract": "The stochastic gravitational wave background from QCD phase transition in the framework of higher-order GUP Zhong-Wen Feng, Long-Xiang Li, Shi-Yu Li, Qing-Quan Jiang, Xia Zhou General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) This work studies the impact of a new higher-order generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) associated with a QCD-scale first-order phase transition. Assuming a strongly first-order transition at the QCD-scale as a phenomenological benchmark, the analysis shows that the sign and magnitude of the dimensionless deformation parameter $\\beta_0$ play a crucial role. For negative $\\beta_0$, the thermodynamic quantities of the radiation fluid develop a maximal temperature beyond which entropy and pressure vanish, and the SGWB spectrum exhibits divergent behavior at high temperatures, so this branch is discarded as phenomenologically inconsistent. For positive $\\beta_0$, the higher-order GUP shifts the SGWB peak frequency towards lower values and slightly enhances the peak energy density, with the size of the effect controlled by $\\beta_0$. For natural values $\\beta_0=\\mathcal{O}\\left( 1 \\right)$ the corrections at QCD temperatures are strongly suppressed, whereas larger benchmark values still compatible with existing experimental and cosmological bounds can induce appreciable shifts in the SGWB spectrum. A future detection of a QCD-scale first-order SGWB would therefore allow the framework developed here to be used to translate the measured signal into constraints on the higher-order GUP parameter, providing an indirect probe of quantum gravity effects.",

In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising from extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework, incorporating the non-Ricci-flat nature of the spacetime. We compute the relevant observables and perform a comparative analysis with the results obtained from the Dudley-Finley (DF) approximation. Our findings indicate that the constraint on the tidal charge remains nearly the same in both approaches MTE and DF thus supporting previous studies on EMRIs in braneworld scenarios within the DF approximation. Furthermore, the difference in the mismatch between the two formulations exhibits deviations as the orbital eccentricity increases. Therefore, these findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also bring out the effectiveness of the DF approximation as well as the importance of the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.",

Barker General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present the results of a blind all-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars in binary systems using data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) using LIGO detectors data. Rapidly rotating, non-axisymmetric neutron stars are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves, whose detection would significantly improve our understanding of the galactic neutron star population and matter under extreme conditions, while also providing valuable tests of general relativity. Neutron stars in binary systems likely constitute a substantial fraction of the unobserved galactic population and, due to potential mass accretion, may emit stronger gravitational-wave signals than their isolated counterparts. This search targets signals from neutron stars with frequencies in the 100-350 Hz range, with orbital periods between 7 and 15 days and projected semi-major axes between 5 and 15 light-seconds. The analysis employs the GPU-accelerated fasttracks pipeline. No credible astrophysical signals were identified, and, in the absence of a detection, we report search sensitivity estimates on the population of neutron stars in binary systems in the Milky Way.",

Ilya Mandel updated version, as accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal Letters High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population is below 170 solar masses if the same priors that are used for individual event analyses in the GWTC catalogs, including for the analysis of GW231123, are applied to the population as a whole. However, this value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.",

By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.",

      "abstract": "The spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from DESI and CMB data Evan McDonough, Elisa G. M. Ferreira Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\\tau$.",

Romanowsky, Grant Tremblay Submitted to ApJ Letters. The single most important new observation is the 600 km/s gradient in the position-velocity diagram, shown in Fig. 7. The discovery paper (van Dokkum et al. 2023) was right about the key interpretation but had quite a few of the details wrong. This is reviewed in section 6.5 Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\\alpha$, [NII]/H$\\alpha$, [SII]/H$\\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.",

There are three dimension-6 SMEFT operators that simultaneously modify the Higgs potential at tree level and contribute to the \\textit{di}-Higgs production at the hadron colliders. With \\textit{di}-Higgs production being suppressed at current LHC runs, we aim to probe this production at high luminosity (HL) and high energy (HE) runs of the LHC to achieve better sensitivity of dimension-6 SMEFT operators.

Varadarajan, Lumen Boco 55 pages, 14 figures. Accepted by JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by \\texttt{JWST}, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\\gtrsim 2\\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\\lesssim 30-50\\%$ at $\\sim 3\\sigma$, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.",

Champion, Michael Kramer 11 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication by A&A High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) One of the imminent science goals of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is the detection of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) emitted by an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). SMBHBs that cause CGWs with GW frequencies $f_\\mathrm{GW} > 10 \\text{nHz}$ have undergone significant orbital evolution, hence a change of $f_\\mathrm{GW}$ over time. In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable. However, using the realistic data set simulations, it was found that other configuration parameters of a PTA, such as the anisotropic distribution of pulsars and the effective number of pulsars in a PTA, can play a crucial role to the importance of this effect.",

Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\\%$ at 50 kpc.",

Tovmassian Accepted for publication in A&A, 12 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) stars are ultra-compact binary systems composed of a white dwarf (WD) primary accreting from a H-deficient donor. They are important as potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and laboratories for gravitational-wave studies, yet their evolutionary history remains unsolved. Three formation channels have been proposed: the WD channel, the He-star channel, and the cataclysmic variable (CV) channel. We aim to provide the first accurate measurements of the fundamental parameters of the accretor in ZTFJ225237.05-051917.4, including the abundances of key elements such as C, N, and Si, by analysing UV spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These measurements provide new insight into the system's evolutionary history and establish it as a benchmark to develop our pipeline for application to a larger sample of AM CVns. We determine the binary parameters from photometric modelling and constrain the atmospheric parameters of the WD accretor, including Teff, logg, and chemical abundances, by fitting the UV spectrum with synthetic spectral models. We then infer the system's formation channel by comparing our results with theoretical evolutionary models. We measure a Teff=23300$\\pm$600K and a surface gravity of logg=8.4$\\pm$0.3, which implies an accretor mass of 0.86$\\pm$0.16 solar masses. We find a high N/C abundance ratio by mass of >153. The accretor is significantly hotter than previous estimates based on simplified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution, underscoring the importance of detailed spectral modelling for determining accurate system parameters. Our results show that UV spectroscopy is well-suited to constraining the formation channels of AM CVn systems. We conclude that the He-star channel can be excluded based on the high N/C ratio, while the WD and CV channels remain consistent with the observations.",
