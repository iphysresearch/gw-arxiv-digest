We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.",

Here, we introduce the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to cosmological backgrounds, and find that if we choose the TT gauge at first order, the second order tensor mode would be gauge invariant. Analogous to the Ricci flat spacetime, the vacuum condition is the key to guarantee the existence of the TT gauge on cosmological backgrounds. When we have the vacuum condition, the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge, the synchronous gauge and the total matter gauge are all equivalent to the TT gauge. Once the vacuum condition is approximately satisfied, the Poisson gauge would reduce to the TT gauge at the same order of approximation. With the sub-horizon limit, the vacuum condition could be obtained approximately, and the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge and the synchronous gauge are all approximated TT gauge. Our findings explain several existing results in the literature and indicate that the proposed TT gauge is useful to discuss higher order gravitational waves.",

Kapaida High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational waves from regular black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals Shailesh Kumar, Tieguang Zi General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We analyze a rotating regular black hole spacetime with an asymptotically Minkowski core, focusing on extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRIs) where a stellar-mass object inspirals a supermassive black hole under consideration. Such spacetimes are also called Kerr-like spacetimes, which motivate the investigation of black holes beyond general relativity and the test of the no-hair theorem. In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves (GWs) that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. In this scenario, as a result of the radiation reaction, we analytically compute the orbital evolution of the moving object. Further, we generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the effect of the additional non-Kerr/deviation parameter with the parameter as small as $\\sim10^{-6}$. The constraint on the parameter in the regular black hole using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-5}$. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors, and further open up ways to put a stringent constraint on non-Kerr parameters with more advanced frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions Flynn Linton, Shubhanshu Tiwari General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step in uniting these two ideas. In recent works [1-7], the loss of coherence of quantum spatial superpositions is explored in the context of the local and global properties of spacetime. Moreover, Danielson et al [2, 3] showed that this decoherence is directly related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. We therefore seek to explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source can effect the coherence of a quantum superposition. In this paper, we identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the oscillatory and memory components of the incident gravitational wave, corresponding to hard and soft graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how decoherence in quantum systems can arise from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also briefly comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.",

This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.",

These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.",

Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.",

While PBHs formed in such a scenario can acquire large spins through sustained tidal torques, the spin distribution remains uncertain and additional accretion might lead to extreme spin values inferred in GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\\mathrm{pbh}}=1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\\times10^{-1}$, lies close to the exclusion bounds from CMB accretion limits and other probes, highlighting a potential tension with current constraints.

Vikman High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\\xi_{max} \\approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\\xi \\approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.",

Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches.

We present a non parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass range ($m \\gtrsim 50\\,M_\\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z \\sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of black hole formation.",

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.",
