      "abstract": "Gravitational radiations from periodic orbits around a black hole in the effective field theory extension of general relativity Shuo Lu, Hao-Jie Lin, Tao Zhu, Yu-Xiao Liu, Xin Zhang General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The study of periodic orbits in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals is essential for understanding the dynamics of small bodies orbiting supermassive black holes. In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and their corresponding gravitational wave emissions within the framework of an effective field theory-based extension of general relativity (EFTGR), which incorporates higher-order curvature terms into the Einstein-Hilbert action. We start with a brief analysis of the modified black hole spacetime in EFTGR and examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. Focusing on the impact of the higher-order curvature terms in EFTGR, we examine the properties of periodic orbits, which are characterized by three topological integers $(z, w, v)$ that uniquely classify their trajectories. By analyzing these orbits within EFTGR, we aim to provide new insights into how strong-field deviations from general relativity may manifest in observable phenomena. We then calculate the gravitational waveforms generated by these periodic orbits, identifying potential observational signatures. Our analysis reveals a direct connection between the zoom-whirl orbital behavior of the small compact object and the gravitational waveforms it emits: higher zoom numbers lead to increasingly intricate waveform substructures. The results contribute to a clearer understanding of the dynamical features of EFTGR and open new avenues for probing black hole properties via gravitational wave detection.",

      "abstract": "Low finesse scattering and spectral drift of gravitational wave echoes Han-Wen Hu, Cheng-Jun Fang, Zong-Kuan Guo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Gravitational wave echoes serve as probes for quantum horizon corrections. While steady-state resonances are assumed in the search of gravitational wave echos, realistic barriers are expected to possess intrinsically low reflectivity. In this work, we investigate this low-finesse limit via time-domain simulations and demonstrate that early-time echoes behave as transient scattered wave packets rather than cavity eigenstates. A central finding is the identification of spectral drift, where the central frequency progressively redshifts. This evolution occurs because high-frequency components dissipate significantly faster than the fundamental mode due to the filtering effect of the potential barrier. To distinguish transient interference from genuine resonance, we establish a physical criterion based on cavity lifetime, identifying a critical reflectivity threshold of approximately $0.37$. Since theoretical models typically operate deep within the overdamped regime below this limit, the resulting signals are spectrally non-stationary. We propose that detection strategies should shift towards dynamic time-frequency tracking to capture these drifting signatures.",

The radiative degrees of freedom are handled within the nonconservative Hamiltonian framework introduced in a companion paper. In this work, we apply the Lie series method to construct a resonant Birkhoff normal-form and the corresponding generator of the radiation-reaction dynamics. The secular piece reconstructs exactly the Peters-Mathews relations for semi-major axis and eccentricity. The oscillatory piece completes the dynamics and is well suited for gravitational wave templates. The procedure we present in this paper can be systematically employed to cast arbitrary nonconservative systems into extended Hamiltonian form so that the Lie method can be applied.",

We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to a dataset of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass black hole mergers injected into stationary Gaussian noise.

(2025) 2650006 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Traversable wormholes are one of the most exciting predictions of General Relativity that offer short-cuts through space-time. However, their feasibility requires the violation of the null energy condition and makes their detection a bit difficult. This paper aims to show the new avenues delving deep into the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes (QNMs) and gray body factors GBFs. These are the two elementary aspects of wave dynamics. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravitational wave observations. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the GBFs in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers have been explored by a general description and then fed to Einstein Gauss Bonnet WH solutions in isotropic as well as anisotropic cases. Finally, a correspondence of the QNM frequencies with radius of the WH shadows has been made and the effect of Gauss Bonnet parameter on the QNM spectra has been discussed.",

The EMRI system consists of a supermassive black hole (BH) and a compact stellar mass object moving around it. We begin with studying the test particle motion around the Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a CoS by using the Lagrangian formalism. Moreover, we investigated the effect of the CoS parameter on the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity. We then turn to the exploration of the impact of the CoS parameter on the gravitational waveforms of the EMRI system. The analysis performed shows that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could detect the CoS imprint in gravitational waveforms when the values of the string cloud parameter $\\alpha \\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^{-6}$.",

      "abstract": "Silencing Newtonian noise using fusion sensor arrays Paul Ophardt, Francesca Badaracco, Katharina-Sophie Isleif General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Newtonian noise (NN) from seismic density fluctuations is expected to limit the low-frequency sensitivity of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, in particular the Einstein Telescope (ET). Current NN mitigation relies on seismometer arrays and Wiener filtering, while distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) offers a complementary, low-cost means of obtaining dense strain measurements. We investigate fusion sensor arrays composed of both displacement-measuring seismometers and strain-measuring DAS-type sensors. We extend the Wiener filter formalism to mixed sensor types and introduce analytic S-wave strain correlation coefficients. Using a hybrid differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation scheme, we validate our approach against established seismometer-only results and analyze the geometry, robustness, and performance of optimized fusion arrays. Fusion arrays enhance P/S-wave disentanglement and achieve NN cancellation levels comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of seismometer-only arrays, particularly for small sensor numbers. When sensors are constrained to the ET infrastructure, we find that six seismometers complemented by fourteen strainmeters inside the ET arms can match the performance of twenty seismometers in boreholes, achieving a residual at the 10% level, and thereby offering a cost-efficient pathway toward ET-scale NN mitigation.",

As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.",

The pipeline adopts a LIGO-style preprocessing and data-loading workflow based on GWOSC time series, with standard whitening and filtering, and is released as a documented Python/PyTorch package. We benchmark AttenGW using simulated injections to estimate sensitive volume and on real O3 data, focusing on the February 2020 segment previously used to evaluate a spatiotemporal graph ensemble. On this month of data, a single AttenGW model reduces the false-positive rate relative to a single graph-based detector by a factor of a few, and an ensemble of three AttenGW models matches the performance of the corresponding six-model ensemble.

The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.",

In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.",

The current state-of-the-art method for identifying such lensing events is a computationally expensive full Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and efficiency of using the overlap of sky localization probability maps (skymaps) to quickly filter potentially lensed gravitational wave signal pairs. We introduce three overlap statistics and test their performance using 200 simulated lensed pairs of gravitational-wave signals across five sets of signal-to-noise ratios. By setting a threshold with a false positive rate of $\\mathrm{FPR} = 10^{-2}$ for the three overlap statistics, we find that we can filter out over $99\\%$ of nonlensed events while retaining all lensed events. The statistics for each event pair can be computed instantly, and can be used in practice to quickly analyze existing events using the skymaps from the low-latency localization pipelines when results from the full parameter estimation are not available.",

Considering the scalar perturbations of the thick brane metric, we obtain the main equations of graviscalar Kaluza-Klein modes. Based on these equations, the frequencies of the graviscalar QNMs of the thick brane are obtained by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin, asymptotic iteration, and numerical evolution methods. The results show that the scalar fluctuation of the thick brane has a series of discrete QNMs, similar to the tensor perturbation of the brane. These modes appear as decaying massive scalar particles in four-dimensional spacetime. We also studied in detail the late time tails of these QNMs and found that some modes have slowly decaying oscillatory tails that may be new sources of the gravitational wave backgrounds.

The double braneworld is a kind of split thick brane, which is crucial for addressing the hierarchy problem in the thick brane scenarios. Using the Bernstein spectral method, direct integration method, and asymptotic iteration method, we calculate the quasinormal mode frequencies of the double brane. We find that the quasinormal spectrum is very different from that of the single brane model, especially the high overtone mode. We also perform numerical evolution to study the time-domain properties of the characteristic modes of the double brane. The results show that when the degree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation attenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore, different long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in a beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split double brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton of the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential phenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in future gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.",

D 112, 124054 - Published 15 December, 2025 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of these systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and secondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA detection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately constant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black hole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test particles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order in the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical under radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of the orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme for waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the secondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular inspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals induces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by LISA.",

The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.",

In this paper, we analyze the dynamical tidal response of static and spherically symmetric BHs in a low-frequency regime within general relativity (GR), based on a matching between the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) methods for an analytical approach to BH perturbations and the worldline effective field theory (EFT) for an efficient and unified computation of the binary dynamics within the post-Newtonian regime. We show that the renormalized tidal response function is subject to inevitable ambiguities associated with the choice of renormalization scheme and with the initial condition of the renormalization flow equation. Once these ambiguities are fixed, we obtain scheme-dependent dynamical tidal Love numbers. We also discuss possible extensions of our formalism, including generic non-rotating compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) in GR and BHs in theories beyond GR.",

In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.",

A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.",

D 112, 123524 (2025) Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \\sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.",

Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.",

Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the Minkovski limit. The latter expansion reveals that the Minkovski approximation breaks down for $\\beta / H_* \\lesssim 10$, where $\\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion.

Accepted to ApJ. Comments welcome! Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\\,M_\\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.",

Volkas 59 pages (44 + 6 app. + 9 refs.), 19 figures, High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) It was previously shown how several explanatory deficiencies of the Standard Model (including the origin of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, small active neutrino mass, strong CP-conservation and the seeds for large-scale structure formation) may be economically resolved when an experimentally-accessible QCD axion also plays the role of the majoron, and the scalar partner of the axion is dynamical during inflation. In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\\nu$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\\nu$ from alternative proposals.",

The author discusses, in depth, the formalism of the effective scalar potential and its different contributions in the loop expansion, points out the necessary ingredients for a first-order transition, and assesses the detectability of the associated gravitational-wave spectrum via future space-based observatories and pulsar timing arrays.

Taylor, Cayenne Matt, Kayhan Gultekin High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) By inferring the gravitational wave background (GWB) from a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) enable the study of massive black holes. In many ways, PTAs manifest the promise of a multimessenger approach to astronomy: they can constrain SMBHB population characteristics that are otherwise difficult to constrain using electromagnetic observations, such as hardening mechanisms at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\\%. Additionally, there is an 88\\% chance that PTA data can reduce the prior uncertainty in the characteristic mass variable of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by 25--50\\%. For $M_{\\text{BH}}$--$M_{\\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations. Our work delineates the domains over which electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data constrain the demographics and dynamics of the supermassive black-hole binary population, offering a clearer picture of the impact of population multi-messenger astrophysics probes with PTAs.",

We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\\odot$ at the 90% confidence level.

In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\\simeq 50 \\%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations.

These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\\pm0.7$, $11.6\\pm2.0$, $15.4\\pm2.7$, and $7.9\\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.",

Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.",

      "abstract": "Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements Andrzej A. Zdziarski, Gregoire Marcel, Alexandra Veledina, Aleksandra Olejak, Debora Lancova Resubmitted to New Astronomy Review High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\\sim$0.1--0.2, with 90\\% having $a_*\\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.",

      "abstract": "Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes Vaibhav Tiwari The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 995, Number 2, December 2025 High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\\odot$, $14M_\\odot$, and $27M_\\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\\odot$. In this article, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.",

      "abstract": "Ameliorating transient noise bursts in gravitational-wave searches for intermediate-mass black holes Melissa Lopez, Giada Caneva, Ana Martins, Stefano Schmidt, Jonno Schoppink, Wouter van Straalen, Collin Capano, Sarah Caudill Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) The direct observation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBH) populations would not only strengthen the possible evolutionary link between stellar and supermassive black holes, but unveil the details of the pair-instability mechanism and elucidate their influence in galaxy formation. Conclusive observation of IMBHs remained elusive until the detection of gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW190521, which lies with high confidence in the mass gap predicted by the pair-instability mechanism. Despite falling in the sensitivity band of current GW detectors, IMBH searches are challenging due to their similarity to transient bursts of detector noise, known as glitches. In this proof-of-concept work, we combine a matched-filter algorithm with a Machine Learning (ML) method to differentiate IMBH signals from non-transient burst noise, known as glitches. In particular, we build a multi-layer perceptron network to perform a multi-class classification of the output triggers of matched-filter. In this way we are able to distinguish simulated GW IMBH signals from different classes of glitches that occurred during the third observing run (O3) {in single detector data}. {We train, validate, and test our model on O3a data, reaching a true positive rate of over $90\\%$ for simulated IMBH signals. To test the generalization ability over the evolutionary observing run, we test on the useen data of O3b, which yields a true positive rate of over $70\\%$} . We also combine data from multiple detectors to search for simulated IMBH signals in real detector noise, providing a significance measure for the output of our ML method.",
