To appear in European Journal of Physics General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures.",

Evans General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det) Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will operate 10-40 km Fabry-Perot arm cavities inside vacuum beam tubes. FFT-based paraxial tools treat propagation in free space and therefore do not explicitly enforce beam tube boundary conditions. We introduce a waveguide-like mode description of the optical field that incorporates an imposed beam tube boundary condition and enables an independent benchmark of free-space FFT tools We derive the associated modal-mixing matrices for mirrors and baffles, including a closed-form series for axisymmetric circular apertures. We quantify the strain-equivalent couplings from baffle miscentering and from a localized near-wall tube defect, and show that they are suppressed as baffle density increases. In the relevant regime of densely baffled cavities and small perturbations, beam tube boundary effects are subdominant, which supports the continued use of FFT-based codes to guide the design of 3G detectors.",

Rodulfo General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) In this paper, we investigate the dynamic phenomenological signatures of a Schwarzschild-MOG black hole shadow perturbed by passing gravitational waves. By perturbing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for photon null geodesics, we demonstrate that the unique field content of MOG breaks the observational degeneracy with standard General Relativity. We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity.",

The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.",

Li, Soichiro Kuwahara, Hiroaki Ohta, Minori Shikauchi, Leo Tsukada, Takuya Tsutsui General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The authors wished to document the sensitivity improvement that has been contributed to the GW detection rate by detection algorithm research and development efforts, and set about re-analyzing S5 and S6 to determine the sensitive time-volumes of a modern pipeline and compare them to that of analysis algorithms of the day. To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\\odot$ and 1.24$M_\\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years.",

Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables.",

Coughlin, Vuk Mandic, Uroš Seljak, Nikolaos Stergioulas General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Many traditional algorithms applied in gravitational-wave astronomy rely on the assumption of Gaussian noise, a condition not always met. To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors.",

      "abstract": "Balance flux laws beyond general relativity David Maibach, Jann Zosso General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) Balance flux laws of asymptotic symmetries in general relativity provide fully non-perturbative constraint equations on gravitational strain. They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.",

Characterized only by the scalar mass $\\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark \"mini-MACHOs\". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\\mu\\gtrsim 10\\,\\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$.

This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon. Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics. Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role.",

Accepted for publication in JCAP Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consist of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165--240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consist of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195--325~nm and 123--200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP--photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\lesssim 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the whole probed ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\\gamma}$ above $2.3 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\\,eV, improving upon previous limits by a factor of seven.",

Version published in JCAP Alexander Steier et al JCAP02(2026)080 Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination. We show, using a blind Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis, that it is possible to infer unbiased estimates of the primordial B-mode signal from ground-based observations of a small patch of sky even for highly complex foreground contamination. This work, originally performed in the context of configuration studies for a future CMB-S4 observatory, is highly relevant for the analysis of observations by the current generation of CMB experiments.",

The nucleation temperature is often used in phase transition analyses, and is defined through the nucleation condition: on average one bubble has nucleated per Hubble volume. We argue that the nucleation temperature is neither a fundamental nor essential quantity in phase transition analysis. We illustrate scenarios where a transition can complete without satisfying the nucleation condition, and conversely where the nucleation condition is satisfied but the transition does not complete. We also find that simple nucleation heuristics, which are defined to approximate the nucleation temperature, break down for strong supercooling. Thus, studies that rely on the nucleation temperature $\\unicode{x2014}$ approximated or otherwise $\\unicode{x2014}$ may misclassify the completion of a transition. Further, we find that the nucleation temperature decouples from the progress of the transition for strong supercooling. We advocate use of the percolation temperature as a reference temperature for gravitational wave production, because the percolation temperature is directly connected to transition progress and the collision of bubbles. Finally, we provide model-independent bounds on the bubble wall velocity that allow one to predict whether a transition completes based only on knowledge of the bounce action curve. We apply our methods to find empirical bounds on the bubble wall velocity for which the physical volume of the false vacuum decreases during the transition. We verify the accuracy of our predictions using benchmarks from a high temperature expansion of the Standard Model and from the real scalar singlet model.",

Following this generic pattern, we demonstrate that solitogenesis after baryogenesis makes the solitons a coincident dark matter candidate, providing new explanations for the coincidence problem between baryon and dark matter energy densities. We derive a novel and robust conclusion: asteroid-mass coincident soliton dark matter is always accompanied by detectable gravitational waves observable by LISA, $\\mu$Ares, and Theia, providing a new candidate beyond primordial black holes in this mass window. Additionally, we propose a simple neutrino-ball scenario that addresses baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and neutrino masses, featuring new particles below the electroweak scale and correlated observable signals, including lensing, gravitational waves, and soliton evaporation or collisions.",
