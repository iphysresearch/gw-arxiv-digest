Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.",

Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity.",

Lobos General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate the observational signatures of a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a spontaneous Kalb-Ramond (KR) background. By normalizing the solution to the physically observable mass $M_{\\text{phys}}$, we demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the KR black hole are consistent with General Relativity, with no deviations in the entropy-area law. However, the Lorentz-violating parameter $l$ induces distinct geometric effects: it suppresses the optical shadow radius by a factor of $\\sqrt{1-l}$ and hardens the quasinormal mode frequency by the inverse factor. Utilizing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for Sagittarius A*, and assuming the mass prior derived from stellar dynamics, we place a constraint of $l \\lesssim 0.19$. While the product of the shadow radius and ringdown frequency remains degenerate with General Relativity, the specific suppression of the shadow size offers a viable pathway to constrain Planck-scale physics with current and future horizon-scale imaging.",

The computations are performed at the relative 2.5PN order. Using the dynamics derived in the companion paper, we first derive the radiated energy and angular momentum, from which we deduce the equations describing the secular evolution of the orbital elements. We numerically solve for the secular dynamics for various systems. We find that the eccentric corrections to tidal terms induce a dephasing that could potentially be detectable in some regions of the parameter space of gravitational wave sources. Finally, we compute the amplitude of the strain, decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics. Besides the memory contributions that are left for future works, we provide the amplitude modes containing the instantaneous, tail and post-adiabatic corrections expanded to the twelfth order in eccentricity.

The equations of motion are decoupled using a generalized harmonic gauge, which avoids the use of a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We point out that sources cannot generically be defined in a compact domain due to fluctuations of the cosmic perfect fluid. For power law cosmologies, we obtain the exact Green's function necessary to solve for all metric perturbations in terms of a hypergeometric function, which matches with a Green's function derived earlier by Chu. This allows us to derive the closed form expression of the linearized metric perturbation generated by sources up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion.",

      "abstract": "Consistent Truncation of Linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time Ghanashyam Date, Harsh General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \\cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation. In \\cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \\cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency.",

      "abstract": "Misinterpreting Spin Precession as Orbital Eccentricity in Gravitational-Wave Signals Snehal Tibrewal, Aaron Zimmerman, Jacob Lange, Deirdre Shoemaker General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.",

At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes.",

Code and data available at this https URL Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) The detection and characterization of post-merger gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers remains challenging with current ground-based detectors. We present a convolutional neural network framework designed for real-time detection and multi-mode frequency extraction of post-merger signals, achieving an inference latency of 3.0 ms and a frequency accuracy of 48.6 Hz on the direct-comparison subsets (53 Hz on the comprehensive test set). The framework is validated on realistic LIGO O4 detector noise including authentic GravitySpy glitch morphologies, demonstrating ROC AUC of 0.999999 and 99.998% detection efficiency at 1% false alarm rate. These exceptional performance metrics arise from an aggressive training augmentation strategy that exposes the network to artificially challenging conditions, enabling robust generalization to our synthetic O4 detector noise model. We compare performance against a simplified matched filtering baseline using Lorentzian templates (23x more accurate despite a 4.7x computational overhead) and Bayesian parameter estimation (1.2 million times faster), establishing complementary trade-offs in the analysis landscape. While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to ~20 Mpc (~1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy.",

In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency.",

The self-consistent multiple cosmological regimes are studied, such as the accelerated expansion, ultra-relativistic, radiation-dominated, sub-relativistic, dust, and stiff matter phases, for three distinct parametrizations of the scale factor: power-law, exponential, and hybrid forms. In particular, five characteristic bouncing scenarios are analyzed: symmetric bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory bounce, matter bounce, and Type IV singularity-free bounce, so that the gravitational Lagrangian can be reconstructed to satisfy bounce conditions at the bounce time. It is found that each scenario requires a violation of the null energy condition, implying the presence of exotic matter with an effective equation of state to drive both the bounce and late-time cosmic acceleration. As a result, it is explicitly demonstrated that higher-order torsion gravity naturally incorporates the bouncing solutions without introducing ad hoc matter fields, providing a possible geometric framework for non-singular early universe evolution. Furthermore, the consistency of the bouncing solutions with the observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave spectrum is shown, while offering testable predictions for primordial perturbations.",

      "abstract": "Effect of Type II Strong Gravitational Lensing on Tests of General Relativity Purnima Narayan, Nathan K. Johnson-McDaniel, Anuradha Gupta General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole (BBH) coalescences provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential to identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising from missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This paper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong gravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard framework for GR tests. In the geometric optics approximation, strong lensing produces three types of images: Type I, Type II, and Type III. While Type I and Type III images do not distort the signal, Type II images introduce a characteristic phase shift that can mimic GR deviations for signals with higher-order modes, precession, or eccentricity. We assess the response of four standard GR tests on simulated Type II lensed BBH signals, including the two parameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. We focus on precessing waveforms for binaries with total masses of $20M_{\\odot}$ and $80M_{\\odot}$, and dimensionless spins of 0.5 and 0.95, considering a fixed signal-to-noise ratio of 25 using the design A+ sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Our findings indicate that more mass-asymmetric and higher-spin binaries show larger false deviations from GR in the TIGER and modified dispersion relation tests when applying GR tests to Type II lensed signals. These results highlight the risk of false GR violations as detector sensitivity improves in future observational runs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of strong lensing before drawing conclusions about deviations from GR in GW signals.",

Rodrigues General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We investigate gravitational waveforms from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems within the framework of quadratic gravity and map their deviations from general relativity into the parameterized post-Einstein (PPE) formalism to constrain the theory parameters. Quadratic gravity generically includes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular momentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical features by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to propagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the quadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including massless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the stationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the massless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations from general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes can be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results that considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the parameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by several orders of magnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations.",

This work explores the potential of the Taiji-TianQin space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detector network to identify the formation channels of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at high redshifts ($z \\gtrsim 10$). The network substantially improves detection capability, boosting the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.2-3.0 (1.06-1.14) relative to TianQin (Taiji) alone. It increases the detection rate of MBHBs formed from light seeds (LS) by more than 2.2 times and achieves over 96\\% detection efficiency for those originating from heavy seeds (HS). Furthermore, the network enables component mass estimation with relative uncertainties as low as $\\sim 10^{-4}$ at the $2\\sigma$ level. These improvements facilitate the assembly of a well-constrained population sample, allowing robust measurement of the fractional contributions from different formation pathways. The network achieves high precision in distinguishing between LS and HS origins (7.4\\% relative uncertainty at $2\\sigma$) and offers moderate discrimination between delay and no-delay channels in HS-origin binaries (24\\%). However, classification remains challenging for delay versus no-delay scenarios in LS-origin systems (58\\%) due to significant population overlap. In conclusion, the Taiji-TianQin network will serve as a powerful tool for unveiling the origins of SMBHs through GW population studies.",

In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about $0.3\\%$ of that of vacuum GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible. In contrast, their impact on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ proves significant. For a range of parameter values, the Starobinsky inflation model yields predictions for $n_s$ that are consistent with the measurements obtained from P+ACT+LB+BK18.",

Comments welcome High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen & Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\\rm f} \\sim 10^{-3} M_\\odot -10^{-1} M_\\odot$ and densities $\\rho_{\\rm f}\\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\\rm f}\\sim 10^{-1} M_\\odot - 1 M_\\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.",

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.

By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic (EM) observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, including up-to-date $H_0$ constraints, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. We also briefly highlight the impact of systematic uncertainties, such as detector calibration, weak lensing, peculiar velocities, and host-galaxy catalog completeness, and corresponding potential mitigation strategies, which currently limit the constraint precision of cosmological parameters. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe.",

However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\\sim2\\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.",

Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.",

      "abstract": "Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges Huan Zhou, Bin Liu, Zheng-Xiang Li, Xi-Jing Wang, Kai Liao Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\\odot}$ is constrained to be $\\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.",

We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.",

Higher frequency gravitational waves never experience superhorizon regime, but they are also amplified after inflation due to the inflaton oscillation. Taking account of the inflaton dynamics after inflation, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves may extend to much higher frequencies than previously thought. In this paper we calculate the spectrum of high frequency gravitational waves produced during and after inflation in detail, in particular focusing on the connection between the low and high frequency regime, and show that the detailed spectrum can distinguish inflation models.",

In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$--$200$~kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\\%$ at $1200$~kpc. In contrast, traditional end-to-end methods yield a TPR below $20\\%$ for rotational signals at distances $\\geq 200$~kpc, and fail to exceed $60\\%$ for neutrino-driven signals even at a close proximity of $10$~kpc.",

      "abstract": "Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics Ishan Swamy, Deobrat Singh High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \\, \\mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.",

      "abstract": "Converging on the eccentricity of massive black hole binaries in galactic mergers Alessia Gualandris, Justin Read, Federica Fastidio, Julian Chan, Thibaut François, Nader Khonji, Walter Dehnen 10 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Binaries of supermassive black holes (MBHBs) represent the primary sources of the gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0~0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB.",
