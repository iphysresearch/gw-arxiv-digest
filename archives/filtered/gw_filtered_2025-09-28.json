In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.",

      "abstract": "Teleportation-based filtering for gravitational-wave detectors Yohei Nishino General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Physics (quant-ph) Employing the principle of quantum teleportation in gravitational-wave detectors provides a method to address technical challenges associated with implementing quantum filters for squeezed-light injection. A recent proposal has shown that an arbitrary number of effective squeezing-angle rotations can be achieved by cascading quantum teleportation, yielding sensitivity equivalent to frequency-dependent pre-filtering. A natural question is whether the teleportation-based protocol can also realize frequency-dependent post-filtering. In this work, we examine this possibility and show that, with perfect teleportation fidelity, post-filtering can be fully implemented. In practice, however, various imperfections make the sensitivity nearly equivalent to that of teleportation-based pre-filtering. We apply this scheme to the low-frequency detector in the Einstein Telescope xylophone configuration and find that teleportation-based post-filtering could also be a candidate for the detector's design.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation Orlando Luongo, Tommaso Mengoni, Paulo M. Sá General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.",

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.",

The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to 10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced drive voltages.",

Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) have been expected to be a new and important informative observation, in particular, in the low-frequency region by making use of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). As an evolutionary process of the SMBHs, we revisit a dark matter (DM) halo-SMBH coevolution model based on the halo merger tree employing an ansatz for the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at $z=6$. In this model, the mass of SMBHs grows through their mergers associated with the halo mergers, and hence the evolutionary information must be stored in the GWs emitted at the mergers. We investigate the stochastic gravitational background from the coalescing SMBH binaries, which the PTAs can detect, and also the GW bursts emitted at the mergers, which can be detected by the mHz band observations such as LISA. We also discuss the possibility of probing the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at high redshift by future GW observations.",

Wilkins 16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{\\rm seed} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{5}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \\sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \\sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{\\rm merger} = 10^{-3.81} (1 + \\delta)^{4.78}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \\lesssim M_{\\rm tot}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot} \\lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \\gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of $0.030~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio ${\\rm SNR} \\geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.",

Swiggum, Haley M. Wahl High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Accurate pulsar astrometric estimates play an essential role in almost all high-precision pulsar timing experiments. Traditional pulsar timing techniques refine these estimates by including them as free parameters when fitting a model to observed pulse time-of-arrival measurements. However, reliable sub-milliarcsecond astrometric estimations require years of observations and, even then, power from red noise can be inadvertently absorbed into astrometric parameter fits, biasing the resulting estimations and reducing our sensitivity to red noise processes, including gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we seek to mitigate these shortcomings by using pulsar astrometric estimates derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) as priors for the timing fit. First, we calibrated a frame tie to account for the offsets between the reference frames used in VLBI and timing. Then, we used the VLBI-informed priors and timing-based likelihoods of several astrometric solutions consistent with both techniques to obtain a maximum-posterior astrometric solution. We found offsets between our results and the timing-based astrometric solutions, which, if real, would lead to absorption of spectral power at frequencies of interest for single-source GW searches. However, we do not find significant power absorption due to astrometric fitting at the low-frequency domain of the GW background.",

A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarcity of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\\rm HG}\\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\\alpha$ ($\\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.",

Due to insufficient spectral information of these molecules at low temperature, the detection and understanding of the importance of these molecules has been rather incomplete. For this purpose, we have carried out the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoabsorption measurements on pure molecular ices of isoprene and a few simple terpenes: limonene, $\\alpha$-pinene and $\\beta$-pinene by forming icy mantles on cold dust analogs. From these experiments, we report the first low-temperature (10 K) VUV spectra of isoprene and its oligomers, limonene, $\\alpha$-pinene, and $\\beta$-pinene. VUV photoabsorption spectra of all the molecules reported here reveal similarities in the ice and gas phase, as expected, except for isoprene, where a prominent red shift is observed in the ice phase absorption. This unique property of isoprene, along with distinctive absorption at longer wavelengths, supports its candidature for detection on icy bodies.",
