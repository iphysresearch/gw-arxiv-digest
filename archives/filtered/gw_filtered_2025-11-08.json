We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star. Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.",

However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations of the velocity of GWs $c_{\\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely Pop\\MakeUppercase{\\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \\(9.50\\), \\(9.33\\), and \\(9.05 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\mathrm{eV}/c^2\\), respectively. We also obtain the corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\\rm gw}$ can be constrained waveform-independently to \\(\\Delta c/c\\) to \\(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\\), corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \\(10^{-26}-10^{-24} \\mathrm{eV}/c^2\\).",

Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.",

Kobayashi, Kazunori Kohri Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \\lesssim f_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\\odot} \\lesssim m_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^3 M_{\\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission.

ASPIRE combines normalizing flows with a generalized Sequential Monte Carlo scheme, enabling efficient updates of existing results and reducing the computational cost of reanalyses by 4-10 times. This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses. We show that ASPIRE reproduces full Bayesian results when switching waveform models or adding physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. With this statistical robustness, ASPIRE turns repeated reanalyses into fast, reliable updatespaving the way for systematic studies of waveform systematics, scalable reanalyses across large event catalogs, and broadly applicable Bayesian reanalysis across other scientific domains.",

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We demonstrate that the properties of eccentric gravitational wave (GW) signals enhance the detectability of GW phase shifts caused by environmental effects (EEs): The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEs can be boosted by up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}^{1 - n}$ with respect to corresponding circular signals, where $\\ell_{\\rm max}$ is the highest modeled eccentric GW harmonic and $n$ is the frequency scaling of the GW dephasing prescription associated to the EE. We investigate the impact on a population level, adopting plausible eccentricity distributions for binary sources observed by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (A+ and A\\# sensitivities), as well as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). For sources in the high eccentricity tail of a distribution ($e \\gtrsim 0.2$ at 10 Hz), phase shifts can systematically be up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}^{1 - n}$ times smaller than in a corresponding circular signal and still be detectable. For typical EEs, such as Roemer delays and gas drag, this effect amounts to SNR enhancements that range from $10^2$ up to $10^5$. For CE and ET, our analysis shows that EEs will be an ubiquitous feature in the eccentric tail of merging binaries, regardless of the specific details of the formation channel. Additionally, we find that the joint analysis of eccentricity and phase shift is already plausible in current catalogs if a fraction of binaries merge in AGN migration traps.",

Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.",

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.",

This approach addresses a key limitation of existing implementations, for which a mismodelling of the statistical properties of the noise can lead to biases in the characterization of the spectral laws, and consequently biases in the recovered CMB maps. We propose a novel framework based on a modified ridge likelihood embedded in an ensemble-average pipeline and derive an analytic bias correction to control noise-induced foreground residuals. We discuss the practical applications of this approach in the absence of true noise information, leading to the choice of white noise as a realistic assumption. As a proof of concept, we apply this methodology to a set of simplified, idealized simulations inspired by the specifications of the proposed ECHO (CMB-Bh$\\overline{a}$rat) mission, which features multi-frequency, large-format focal planes. We forecast the $95 \\%$ upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{95}$, under a suite of realistic noise scenarios. Our results show that for an optimistic full sky observation, ECHO can achieve $r_{95}\\leq 10^{-4}$ even in the presence of significant correlated noise, demonstrating the mission's capability to probe primordial gravitational waves with unprecedented sensitivity. Without degrading the statistical performance of the traditional component separation, this methodology offers a robust path toward next-generation B-mode searches and informs instrument design by quantifying the impact of noise correlations on cosmological parameter recovery.",

Furuta, Yuta Hamada, Kazunori Kohri 15 pages, 6 figures, to appear in PRD High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph) We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background.

      "abstract": "Mass-radius relationship and gravitational wave emission from magnetized spheroidal quark stars Rajasmita Sahoo, Arunkarthiheyan Thiyagarajan, Asutosh Panda, Somnath Mukhopadhyay Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) In this work, we investigate the structure and gravitational wave (GW) signatures of strongly magnetized, oblate spheroidal quark stars by employing an anisotropic equation of state (EoS) derived from the MIT Bag model, extended to include the effects of density-dependent strong magnetic fields and the resulting pressure anisotropy arising from the breaking of spatial symmetry. Both magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) and magnetized color-flavor locked (MCFL) phases are examined within the framework of the $\\gamma$-metric formalism, which captures the deviation from spherical symmetry. We compute the mass-radius relation, ellipticity, gravitational redshift, mass quadrupole moment and tidal deformability for representative bag constants of $\\rm{65\\,MeV/fm^3}$ and $\\rm{75\\,MeV/fm^3}$. Using the obtained quadrupole moments, we further estimate the continuous gravitational wave strain amplitude ($h_{0}$) for isolated deformed rotating quark stars. Our results indicate that density-dependent strong magnetic fields and color superconductivity can significantly alter stellar compactness and yield gravitational wave signals, potentially detectable by next generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.",

Kranzhoff, Juliane von Wrangel, David S. Wu Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.",

      "abstract": "Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust Lei Zhang, Jinhai Zhang, Han Yan, Xian Chen Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph) The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.",
