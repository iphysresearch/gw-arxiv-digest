      "abstract": "There and back again -- Closed timelike curves as EFT selection principle Bum-Hoon Lee, Nils A. Nilsson, Somyadip Thakur General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Modified gravity is often approached in the context of effective-field theory (EFT), with the view that the EFT corrections permit a more desirable theory. In this paper, we posit that this should extend to the causal structure of curved spacetime in addition to the standard demands such that of flat spacetime positivity and unitarity. We propose a new guiding principle for modified-gravity theories, namely that closed timelike curves should always be {\\it harder} to obtain than in General Relativity. By demanding this, one can place powerful constraints on modified gravity. To elucidate this claim, we investigate modified-gravity EFTs on rotating black-hole backgrounds, focusing on the appearance/disappearance of closed timelike curves, and provide parameter bounds which only partly overlap with other approaches based on time delay. We construct perturbative rotating black-hole solutions in modified-gravity EFTs based on the Horndeski class and provide parameter bounds necessary to preserve causality and stability. Finally, we present a novel probe for the existence of closed timelike curves through quasinormal modes and black-hole echoes. This can be used to diagnose spacetime causality once next-generation gravitational-wave data becomes available.",

      "abstract": "Scaling Laws for Template-Free Detection of Environmental Phase Modulation in Gravitational-Wave Signals Jericho Cain General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Environmental effects such as hierarchical triple motion can introduce cumulative phase modulation in gravitational-wave signals through time-dependent line-of-sight acceleration. Whether such smooth time-warp distortions are observable depends jointly on deformation strength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yet this relationship has not been quantified in a template-free framework. We study the detectability of these distortions using time-frequency representations derived from the continuous wavelet transform. Instead of reconstruction error alone, we examine trajectory-based statistics, in particular the evolution of the power-weighted frequency centroid. We find that environmental modulation can be detected using a single-sample statistic referenced to an isolated-binary distribution, without requiring matched templates. Across a grid of cumulative phase distortions and SNR, detection performance collapses onto a single scaling parameter defined as the product of phase distortion and SNR. The ROC-AUC follows a sigmoid transition in this parameter. Moderate distortions are detectable at low SNR, whereas smaller distortions require higher SNR. These results indicate that smooth environmental phase modulation is not generically absorbed by intrinsic waveform variability; instead, detectability is governed by a simple scaling between cumulative phase distortion and signal strength.",

Motivated by this work, I revisit the problem using current solar models, updated detector sensitivities, and improved theoretical and observational constraints on mode amplitudes. In this study, I compute the gravitational response of solar oscillation modes using standard solar models generated with \\texttt{MESA}, and mode eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions calculated with \\texttt{GYRE}. I focus primarily on solar $g$ modes, evaluating their responses for degree $l=2$ and azimuthal orders $m=0$ and $m=2$. The analysis incorporates both the earlier proposed and the current updated LISA sensitivity curves, and I perform a comparative assessment with the TianQin mission in the relevant low-frequency band. To assess the robustness of the predicted signals, I estimate the gravitational responses using two different standard solar models based on the GS98 and AGSS09 abundance compilations. I find that the resulting signal responses are nearly identical for the two models, indicating that uncertainties in solar metallicity have a negligible impact on the detectability of solar $g$ modes by space-based interferometers.",

Sriramkumar Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) Cosmological vector fields are central to many early-Universe phenomena, including inflationary dynamics, primordial magnetogenesis, and dark-matter scenarios. However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non--slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non--slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe. Our results introduce new avenues for enhancing primordial magnetic fields and their associated gravitational-wave signals, opening promising possibilities for their future detection and interpretation, both with cosmological and gravitational wave probes.",

D General Physics (physics.gen-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc) We propose a new mechanism for generating cosmological relics -- black holes, gravitational waves (GWs), and possibly dark matter (DM) -- in a bouncing Universe. Relics arise through two channels: (i) compact objects and GWs produced during pre-bounce collapse that remain super-horizon and re-enter after the bounce, and (ii) dark-matter halos formed during collapse that exit the horizon and collapse into black holes upon re-entry. Unlike inflationary primordial black holes, these relic black holes originate from nonlinear structure formation during collapse. We derive the particle horizon and horizon-crossing conditions in bouncing cosmology and show that perturbations or compact objects larger than 90 m survive the bounce. The resulting population of relic black holes and GWs spans a wide mass range, offering a unified origin for dark matter, gravitational-wave backgrounds, and the early growth of supermassive black holes and galaxies.",

The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7<z<1.8$ with a catalog of $\\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\\sim 26%$ on $\\Omega_{\\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $\\Omega_{\\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories.",

After reviewing the basic properties of this spacetime, we study the ultrarelativistic limit in which the black hole is boosted to the speed of light, while sending its mass to zero. This results in a non-expanding impulsive wave traveling in the LCBR universe. The wave front is a 2-sphere carrying two null point particles at its poles -- a remnant of the structure of the original static spacetime. It is also shown that the obtained line-element belongs to the Kundt class of spacetimes, and the relation with a known family of exact gravitational waves of finite duration propagating in the LCBR background is clarified. In the limit of a vanishing electromagnetic field, one point particle is pushed away to infinity and the single-particle Aichelburg-Sexl pp-wave propagating in Minkowski space is recovered.",

In this work, we test Giddings' nonviolent nonlocality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from nonviolent nonlocality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in nonviolent nonlocality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.",

Final version published in Physics Letters B Phys. Lett. B 874 (2026) 140272 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\\lesssim 2\\,\\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\\simeq 20\\,M_\\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.",

Tetradis Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th) The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.",

Crucially, we prove on general grounds that, in the absence of dissipation, the exponential representation of the $S$-matrix maps -- through a partial-wave transformation -- directly onto the scattering phase shift from black hole perturbation theory (BHPT), indicating an exponentiation of the WQFT amplitude itself in partial-wave space. Computing explicitly, we reproduce the BHPT phase shift without spin up to $O(G^{3})$ from WQFT. While this result is expected, it lays the groundwork for higher-precision analyses involving non-minimal effects. Along the way, we outline our efficient diagram generation technique and include a pedagogical discussion on the computation of the required two-loop integrals.",

While static EoS models are increasingly well-constrained by observations of binary neutron star (BNS) inspirals, the possibility of a dynamic phase transition occurring during the coalescence has been thus far deferred from standard gravitational-wave (GW) analyses. In this work, we investigate the detectability of such a phase transition, manifesting as a macroscopic shift in the tidal deformability parameter $\\Lambda$, using GWs from Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH) coalescences. We argue that NSBH systems serve as a cleaner laboratory for this phenomenology than BNS systems due to the absence of the $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\Lambda_1,\\Lambda_2)$ degeneracy, allowing for the isolation of single-body tidal evolution. We introduce a phenomenological waveform model, TROYE (Transitional Representation Of varYing Equation-of-state), which stitches together two waveform approximants in the time domain to simulate a smooth but rapid transition between two equations of state during the late inspiral. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian injection and recovery campaign on 100 simulated events using the bilby inference library. Our results demonstrate that a phase transition corresponding to a tidal shift of $|\\Delta\\Lambda| \\gtrsim 400$ is detectable with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, yielding decisive statistical evidence ($\\ln B > 5$). We further identify a \"V-shape\" asymmetry in detectability, where \"softening\" transitions (decreasing $\\Lambda$) are systematically easier to detect than \"stiffening\" ones due to the specific phase evolution of the tidal sector. Finally, we present \"stress tests\" showing that the transition remains recoverable even when marginalized over uncertainties in the stitching time and binary mass ratio.",

Toonen, E. Laplace, F. Dosopoulou Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR) Although mass transfer (MT) has been studied primarily in circular binaries, observations show that it also occurs in eccentric systems. We investigate orbital evolution during nonconservative MT in eccentric orbits, a process especially relevant for binaries containing compact objects (COs). We examined four angular momentum loss (AML) modes: Jeans, isotropic reemission, orbital-AML, and $L_2$ mass loss, with the last mode being the most efficient AML mode. For a fixed AML mode and accretion efficiency, orbital evolution is correlated: orbits either widen while becoming more eccentric, or shrink while circularizing. Jeans mode generally yields orbital widening and eccentricity pumping, whereas $L_2$ mass loss typically leads to orbital shrinkage and eccentricity damping. Isotropic reemission and orbital-AML show an intermediate behavior. Adopting isotropic reemission, we demonstrate that eccentric MT produces compact binaries that merge via gravitational waves (GW) within a Hubble time, whereas the same systems would instead merge during MT under traditional modeling. We further show that, in eccentric orbits, the gravitational potential at $L_2$ becomes lower than at $L_1$ across a wide range of mass ratios and eccentricities, naturally linking eccentricity to $L_2$ mass loss. Eccentric MT may therefore lead to the formation of the circumbinary disks observed around eccentric post-red-giant-branch and post-asymptotic-giant-branch systems. Since interacting binaries containing COs are frequently eccentric, $L_2$ mass loss offers a new robust pathway to orbital tightening during eccentric MT, contributing to the formation rate of GW sources. This model can treat orbital evolution due to conservative and nonconservative MT in arbitrary eccentricities, with applications ranging from MT on the main sequence to GW progenitors.",

LISA's interferometers must deliver pm/rtHz sensitivity while accommodating beam tilts up to 1 mrad at the photodiodes, which degrade the interferometric amplitude and increase the induced readout noise coupling. This paper uses an analytical framework developed by the authors in a previous work, based on minimal and justified approximations, that relates beam tilt to the resulting heterodyne signal amplitude in a generic two-beam interferometer with circular-area photodiodes (PDs). A set of interferometric topologies is analyzed, all of high relevance for LISA. We derive the exact amplitude response for an infinite detector and a closed-form approximation for finite detectors, and we validate both against numerical simulations and experimental measurements on an ultra-stable LISA-representative testbed. We then use this model to quantify the phase-noise amplification arising from reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under tilt, showing that curvature mismatches between the interfering beams substantially enhance this effect. Finally, we introduce a compact function that captures the angular dependence of correlated and uncorrelated phase noises in quadrant photodiode (QPD)-based readouts. Here, a new noise feature, caused by wavefront curvature mismatch, is predicted and measured for the first time. These results indicate that controlling wavefront curvature mismatch in the test mass interferometer (TMI) is essential to limit excess phase noise. The models and results derived in this paper, although originating in the context of LISA, are general and can be applied to any interferometric topology undergoing tilts with pivot on the detector plane.",
