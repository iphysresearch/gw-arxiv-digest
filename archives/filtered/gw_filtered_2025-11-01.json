Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \\cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.",

Such a multi-detector network will provide complementary viewing angles for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), thereby significantly enhancing the capability to reconstruct and localize its spatial distribution. In this paper, we have established the first dedicated data analysis pipeline for the anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background using a joint network of TianQin, LISA, and Taiji. Our analysis incorporates both Gaussian, stationary, and unpolarized point sources from diverse sky locations as well as a random sky map. We have performed full-sky map reconstruction in pixel space using maximum likelihood estimation to extract the angular distribution of the SGWB. The results demonstrate that, when considering the detector noise, the TianQin+LISA+Taiji detector network can reconstruct the angular power spectrum of the stochastic background up to a maximum multipole moment of $l = 14 $, which can provide valuable information for studies on the spatial distribution of galactic compact binaries and physical imprints from the early Universe.",

We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.",

This imbalance between left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, quantified via the Stokes pseudo-scalar $V_{\\rm GW}$, originated from mirror asymmetries in the binary. We scan the parameter space of black-hole mergers to investigate correlations between $V_{\\rm GW}$ and chiral magnitudes constructed out of the intrinsic parameters of the binary. To this end, we use both numerical-relativity simulations for (quasi-circular) and eccentric precessing mergers from both the SXS and RIT catalogues, as well as the state-of-the-art surrogate model for quasi-circular precessing mergers NRSur7dq4. We find that, despite being computed by manifestly different formulas, $V_{\\rm GW}$ is linearly correlated to the helicity of the final black hole, defined as the projection of its recoil velocity onto its spin. Next, we test our ability to perform accurate measurements of $V_{\\rm GW}$ in gravitational-wave observations through the injection and recovery of numerically simulated signals. We show that $V_{\\rm GW}$ can be estimated unbiasedly using the surrogate waveform model NRSur7dq4 even for signal-to-noise ratios of nearly 50, way beyond current gravitational-wave observations.",

Firstly, by using the effective potential, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits are investigated. It is found that the radius, orbital angular momentum, and energy increase with the hair parameter for both orbits. Based on these results, we examine one special type of orbit, the periodic orbit, around the black hole without the Cauchy horizon. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. In particular, we observe a significant deviation from the Schwarzschild case for small hair parameter with a large amount of external mass outside the black hole horizon. Moreover, we examine the waveforms in the extreme mass ratio inspiral system to explore the orbital information of the periodic orbits and the constraints on the parameters of the black holes. The results reveal that the gravitational waveforms can fully capture the zoom-whirl behavior of periodic orbits. Moreover, the phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central supermassive black hole without a Cauchy horizon.",

Mohanty Phys. Rev. D 112, 084075 Published 29 October, 2025 General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM) Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy\" spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \\sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\\delta \\tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\\delta \\tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.",

Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small.

We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk.

This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\\Delta G\\mu / G\\mu < 0.5$ for $G\\mu > 3.5 \\times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.",

We show, using a blind Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis, that it is possible to infer unbiased estimates of the primordial B-mode signal from ground-based observations of a small patch of sky even for highly complex foreground contamination. This work, originally performed in the context of configuration studies for a future CMB-S4 observatory, is highly relevant for the analysis of observations by the current generation of CMB experiments.",

Submitted to AAS journals High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO) Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks based on timing observation,including the stripping scenario and the orbiter-disk scenario, and assess their GW detectability by LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with frictional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.",

      "abstract": "Testing the type-II seesaw mechanism with gravitational waves Yonghua Wang, Wei Chao High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos. Nevertheless, they face significant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale associated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in terrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves (GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw particles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a high-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the seesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity.",

      "abstract": "The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks Maria Paola Vaccaro, Yannick Seif, Michela Mapelli High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA) Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are often assumed to form at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $10^8 M_\\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps ($\\gtrsim 80\\%$). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups can prevail. Certain disk configurations (e.g., $\\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\\bullet < 10^6 M_\\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups even in the absence of traps due to traffic-jam accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.",

      "abstract": "Population of Binary Black Holes Inferred from One Hundred and Fifty Gravitational Wave Signals Vaibhav Tiwari High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE) The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave signals from more than 150 binary black holes in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\\odot$ and $27M_\\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.",

In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.",

Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the \"acausal optimum,\" which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two candidate sensing systems using their modeled sensitivity: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.",
